#DataScience #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #DataScienceCareer#DataScienceJobs #ArtificialIntelligenceCareer #MachineLearningCareer #CareerAdvice

If you want to start AI tomorrow there are three things I would say that you should have. One is figuring out what kind of learning do you like? Do you like to learn from a book or do you like watching videos? I like watching videos. When you‚Äôre watching videos are you taking notes? Those kinda things, figure out your learning curve, how are you going to do that. Second thing is, find more friends. You can find people in the forums, you can talk to them and see and have this kind of a community wherein you can go to; you can go to data science meetups and meet people who are also the same, following the same paths, struggling to learn, etc.
Then the third thing is, you‚Äôre having people who have already gone through this. Have some mentors. I think that really helps a lot. Talking to them will make a lot more sense to you; you would also know where you‚Äôre going wrong and you can also say that this is the path I want to learn. There is going to be a lot of clarity which you‚Äôre going to get. And the fourth thing that I am going to say is this ‚Äì Do not get stuck in theory. It has to be hands-on. Unless and until you run your first model, understand and run your first model, it‚Äôs ok even if it‚Äôs a blackbox, just run it. Even if you don‚Äôt understand python, just run it. Download a notebook and just run it on a Google Collab or whatever it is, but just run it. It‚Äôs OK. Be more hands-on. Only then you‚Äôll learn a lot more. So, 3 things: Figure out the course, whatever you want to do; have a support structure of friends, forums, etc have couple of mentors or a mentor who is going to help you out and the fourth thing, Be HandsOn, do more projects. I would say that breaking into data science is just equivalent to breaking into software engineering for someone who does not have that kind of background. To split it down into atomic parts, I would say that you need to be passionate about that field, you need to get a strong hold of the basics, basic technical skills that you require for that field. Apart from that you should probably choose an industry in which you have an inherent interest. For example if you‚Äôre interested in Finance, you should look for roles in the financial industry as a data scientist. And apart from that you should have a knack of augmenting your knowledge regularly because it is an ever evolving field so everyday you have new research papers being published, the amazing research that is happening in the AI and the community. And there a new tools that you get to use for implementing your solutions. You should have that sort of curiosity and that sort of drive in you to learn something new each day and keep augmenting your knowledge. If you feel you identify with this kind of a skill set you‚Äôre on the right path of transitioning into data science. The thing people still have confusion that anyone can be a data scientist or not. So I will say anyone can be a data scientist. Even I'm mentoring one student, he has absolutely no background of maths and coding and he is doing fine, very good in the data science track.",347059,8268,196,0,165

Data Scientists are expert professionals equipped with a combination of coding, mathematical, statistical, analytical, and ML skills. They explore and examine large datasets gathered from multiple sources, clean it, organize it, and process it to facilitate the ease of interpretation. While they can do analyzing tasks of an analyst, they also have to work with advanced ML algorithms, predictive models, programming and statistical tools to make sense of data and develop new processes for data modelling.
#DataScientists can also be labelled as a Data Researcher or a Data Developer, depending upon the skill set and job demand.

So, you want to become a data scientist? Great! Our free step by step guide will walk you through how to start a career in data science: https://bit.ly/3uq4VNo

A recent report by The Hindu states that there are an estimated 97,000 data analytics job openings in India (Bengaluru accounts for 24% of these job openings, while Delhi/NCR for 22%). 

Since the data science field is progressing at an extremely fast rate, the huge demand for data science talent, especially in the Technology/IT and Industrial domain, can hardly catch up with the supply of skilled data scientists. That‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise that a significant part of the data scientists in India (more than 40%) have received a ‚Äòdata scientist‚Äô job title within the last 24 months. 

So, becoming a data scientist in India seems like a truly golden opportunity. Let‚Äôs see what that means in terms of salaries!

According to upgrad.com, ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù is the highest paying job in India. To be more precise, the average data scientist salary listed on Glassdoor is above 1,000,000 rupees per year and it could go up to 2,000,000 rupees for more experienced candidates.

Of course, corporations based in large cities like Mumbai and Bangalore offer higher salaries. But keep in mind that this may soon change. Many international companies prefer to open an office in Hyderabad, as it‚Äôs much more affordable. No wonder giants like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and P&G already call Hyderabad their home. And that translates into even more career opportunities for data scientists in India...

It will significantly benefit the data analysis process as well as the results from that analysis.  Exploring your mindset and getting to place of neutrality and purpose while working can help clear the mind to do a more thorough and complete study.  Look at the big picture and the small; understand the bias and the purpose.   Data analytics is as much an art as it is a science.  Anyone with any background can be curious and investigate information to tell a complete story.  Data analyst for a large university by day, an instructional designer for a sales training company by afternoon, and a mom/wife/sister/aunt/friend by night. A recent graduate of the online Master of Learning Technology program, she is in the process of changing careers and incorporating her perspective from each of her backgrounds. As a student, she has presented at multiple conferences, both academic and workshop format.  And this past year, with a team of her peers, published her first article.

All About Python

Python¬†is an¬†interpreted,¬†high-level,¬†general-purpose¬†programming language. Created by¬†Guido van Rossum¬†and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes¬†code readability¬†with its notable use of¬†significant whitespace. Its¬†language constructs¬†and¬†object-oriented¬†approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

is video mein aap ye jaanenge ki computer programming kya hota hai, programmer kaun hota hai, kitne prakhar ke programming languages hote hai.

A computer is a general purpose machines which can perform many computational task and the modern day computers that we have they can perform billions or trillions of calculations within a fraction of second. 
These computer's they can't really do anything on their own. so for a computer to do something one has to give the instructions to it and these instructions will contain step by step information to perform a specific task and these are called as program.

The person who is going to write these instructions or the program is called as the programmer and here the programmer will write the program and the computer will execute that or computer will work on that instructions

The language in which the instructions are written or the language in which this program is written is called as the programming language. now there are several types of programming languages available.

Computers are built to understand the binary language / machine language and since it is difficult to code, assembly languages are invented.
After that middle and higher level languages were invented.

program written in middle / higher language are converted to machine code and executed in either through the compilation method or by using the interpretation method.

languages which use compilation method are called as compiled languages.
for example c, c++ etc.

languages which use interpretation method are called as interpreted languages.
for example python

The first 100 people to go to http://blinkist.com/techlead are going to get unlimited access for 1 week to try it out. You‚Äôll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.

Over the years, you find that programming is a field littered with pitfalls.  I've seen so many health problems in my colleagues.  And mental burnout, low productivity, loss of focus, and getting lost in the weeds.  For those lucky enough to have landed a job in programming, they are not out of the woods just yet.  Learn my top 7 habits for being an effective coding machine.  

I like the word habit here.  A habit is a fundamental change in behavior and mindset.  I think that's the key -- any short-term ""tip"" or ""trick"" can only yield short-term results.  It is the long-lasting value of good habits that will power you through decades of coding.  How many people do you know who have been coding for a decade and still manage to stay happy and healthy?  Yep, just one (me).

182,ReVeUvwTGdU,3 years of Computer Science in 8 minutes,Programming,2018-07-24T17:00:13Z,"This is the most asked question on my channel by far so I thought I'd explain how I learned programming. In the process I got a little distracted and accidentally explained all of computer science in 8 minutes (kind of). 

The goal of this video was to show you the connections between modern day (high-level) programming and how it was implemented at the low level. I show you the basics in Java and convert it to C code, then into Assembly, which leads me to talk about how computers perform addition/subtraction, and the logic design behind that is all implemented with transistors. In case you couldn't tell, I love low level programming. Just a disclaimer that I'm not saying this is the best way to learn programming I am simply sharing what I feel was the most valuable in my learning so far. I know many people start with web technologies which can be a great introduction as well! I am currently teaching myself a lot of server networking & all that stuff. I just believe if you really want to understand how to design algorithms and solve problems in creative ways then the most valuable things you can learn are at the low level. Even though C is 40 years old it is still regarded as producing the most efficient code since you have full control over pointers and memory management with minimal overhead. (the only thing faster is assembly.. an even lower level)

She wants to create a more diverse and colourful world of technology, starting with the poetry of code.

Linda Liukas is a programmer, storyteller and illustrator. Her children's book, Hello Ruby, raised a total of $380,000 on Kickstarter. She founded Rails Girls, which has organized workshops in over 230 cities, teaching the basics of programming to more than 10,000 women. Linda worked at Codeacademy, which she left to write stories that teach children about software and programming. She won the 2013 Ruby Hero prize and was named the Digital Champion of Finland by the EU Commissioner for Digital Agenda.

He already has 15 iOS apps to his name and dreams of designing for Apple. At age 12, Santiago became a full-time college student and is on track to earn his bachelor's degree in computer science and electrical engineering by age 16.  By 17, when most teenagers are excited to just have their driver's license, Santiago will have his masters degree. 

A self-professed computer nerd, Santiago is fluent in a dozen different programming languages and thousands of people have downloaded his apps for the Mac, iPhone and iPad.

Learn how Santiago's parents overcame a rigid school system that left their son intellectually stifled and depressed and instead followed an unconventional pathway to nurture his incredible gifts. Santiago's story is truly inspiring and his family's experience provides a powerful model for parents of exceptionally gifted children.

In the last few episodes, our instructions were already in our computer‚Äôs memory, but we need to talk about how they got there - this is the heart of programming. Today, we‚Äôre going to look at the history of programming and the innovations that brought us from punch cards and punch paper tape to plugboards and consoles of switches. These technologies will bring us to the mid 1970s and the start of home computing, but they had limitations, and what was really needed was an easier and more accessible way to write programs - programming languages. Which we‚Äôll get to next week.

Tableau vs Excel - Not sure when to use Tableau and when to use Excel?

Well, many people are uncertain about the difference between them. And that‚Äôs a reasonable doubt, until we point out they serve different purposes. Using Tableau doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you can forget about Excel, and vice versa. 

Tableau has grown to become one of the most popular business intelligence tools in the entire world. It is a BI software that allows non-technical users to visualize their data and work with it almost immediately, lowering know-how barriers dramatically.
In the past, business analysts needed the help of IT personnel who would assist them in gathering raw data and pre-processing it. Only then could business analysts start working on the visualization of such data. The advent of Tableau democratized this process and allowed BI analysts to be independent. Non-technical people can easily load data into the program and start playing with it. Tableau‚Äôs forte are meaningful and intuitive visualizations. And sometimes that‚Äôs really valuable. Analysts are able to explore their data right away, without spending too much time on numbers which provide limited insights and instead focus on data that matters.
This is why we can confidently say that Tableau is an indispensable tool in the arsenal of most corporate business intelligence analysts, data analysts, and data scientists.
While Excel is not as powerful or intuitive as Tableau when it comes to data visualization, Tableau is not optimal when you would like to use it as a data creation tool. Although it has several database management functionalities, the program isn‚Äôt the best solution when you would like to perform multiple operations with your data before you start analysing it. Moreover, Tableau isn‚Äôt great for multi-layered calculations. It is able to calculate its own fields, but it shouldn‚Äôt be used as a spreadsheet tool for multi-layered calculations such as the preparation of a budget in Excel.
We can agree that a competent analyst needs both Excel and Tableau given that they serve different purposes.

Get Tableau Certified, guaranteed - https://www.artofvisualization.com/

Sankey Diagrams display flows and their quantities in proportion to one another. The width of the arrows or lines are used to show their magnitudes, so the bigger the arrow, the larger the quantity of flow. Flow arrows or lines can combine together or split through their paths on each stage of a process. Colour can be used to divide the diagram into different categories or to show the transition from one state of the process to another.

INTRODUCTION
CONNECING TO THE DATA

2:02 - We'll connect the data, connect to our Excel file and we'll connect to our African mobile data Excel file.
2:15 - We'll bring in our sales data and you'll see that we have the full 1056 rows that we‚Äôre looking for.
2:41 - You have your SELECT statement, then you tell them what columns to bring in.
WORKING WITH DATA

2:57 - So what we're going to do, is we're going to take this; we're going to Union all, with the exact same data set.
3:24 - So we'll put it in segment right here, we'll call this ""VizSide""
3:32 - Then over here, we're going to call this region, as ""VizSide"".
4:07 - So what we actually need to do, is somehow create these marks so Tableau will be able to draw the lines across them. ¬†
4:38 - I'm going to walk you through the first steps of that data densification
5:22 - ¬†So now we have ToPad, the thing is if you bring ToPad out to columns.
5:37 - But if you come down, you click on it you say create bins
6:17 - So we've basically done is used Tableaus in-memory engine, to create these extra marks
CREATING CALCULATIONS

6:31 - Next, we're going to create a calculated field called T.
6:44 - What this does is a little bit of an offset, that evenly spaces all our marks across the view.
7:10 - We have a value of 1 we have our value of 49 but we also have a mark for every single individual bin. This is the essence of data densification and data padding.
7:26 - So, now we have our vertical marks, we have vertical data sets, our horizontal marks.
8:01 - Now we're going to come in and we‚Äôre going to duplicate that, and we will edit, call this Rank 2 - I'm actually going to leave it entirely the same.
8:17 - The next calculated field we need to make is our sigmoid function. The sigmoid function right here off Wikipedia mathematical function with an s-shaped curve.
8:32 - So we're going to create a sigmoid. It is going to be 1 over 1 plus; now we need to use e; Tableau doesn't have e as a function but it does have an exponent function.
8:48 -  So if we do exponent 1 that's the same thing as typing e. Then we're going to raise it to the power of negative T.
BUILDING A VIEW
10:17 - Ok those a lot of different calculations and now we get to the exciting part, where we're actually going to build out our view for a little bit. 
10:55 - At this point we'll need to add in the two sides of our table or the two sides of our visualization that we‚Äôre building. 
11:13 - So we want it to include Segment, we want to include Region and then we want to include Padded because it tells you go from Segment to go to Region a long Padded.
11:30 - Coming up to Rank 2 we're going to use all three again, but in this case, we want it to go from Padded, sorry from Region to Segment to Padded.
11:42 ‚Äì And then for T we're going to make sure that it's using Padded so that our sigmoid function is able to comprehend every single mark.
12:19 - In the same spirit we will come to our curve and make it go from 0 to 1.
12:46 - Then we can come in we can hide our headers and we have very good makings of our Sankey Chart.
13:44 - So, what we need to do rather than using sum sales itself, we're going to create another calculation. We call this a Sales Sizing and we'll use a table calculation in order to trick Tableau
15:27 - We want to come into our color scheme as well and rather than being blue orange red will make it blue orange green just so it matches our Sankey Chart.
CREATING A DASHBOARD
16:13 - Now we're going to create a dashboard that has all three of them.
16:25 - So first we're going to bring in our Sankey Chart. Then we'll add in Segment to the side and we'll add in Region to the other side.
16:40 - Then we'll do some more cosmetic stuff where we'll hide the actually don't need these titles either. As we come through we can format we can get rid of our gridlines we can get rid of our 0 lines clean that up a little
17:22 - A couple more cosmetic things we're going to do real fast. Our tool tips are really distracting at this point. So I'm going to go, I'm going to disable them on all of our charts.
18:18 - The last thing we want to add is actually some dashboard actions.",271835,1926,40,0,256

A donut chart is essentially a Pie Chart with an area of the center cut out.

However, Donut Charts have a slight advantage over Pie Charts, which are sometimes criticized for focusing on relative sizes of the pieces to one another and the chart as a whole, giving no indication of changes as a whole when compared to other Pie Charts.

A Donut Chart partly addresses this problem by de-emphasizing the use of the area, to make the viewer focus more on the changes in overall values. You are focused on reading the length of the arcs, rather than comparing the proportions between slices.

Also, Donut Charts can take up less space than Pie Charts by having their centers used to display information within their blank centers.

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù to produce reliable results. 

Below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. 
Python has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next ""Big Thing"" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

Customer Review

Sairaam Varadarajan, Data Evangelist at Medtronic, Tempe, Arizona: ""I took Big Data and Hadoop / Python course and I am planning to take Apache Mahout thus becoming the ""customer of Edureka!"". Instructors are knowledge... able and interactive in teaching. The sessions are well structured with a proper content in helping us to dive into Big Data / Python. Most of the online courses are free, edureka charges a minimal amount. Its acceptable for their hard-work in tailoring - All new advanced courses and its specific usage in industry. I am confident that, no other website which have tailored the courses like Edureka. It will help for an immediate take-off in Data Science and Hadoop working.""",207674,2646,95,0,91
259,reY50t2hbuM,Why You Should NOT Learn Machine Learning!,Deep Learning,2020-10-01T20:31:50Z,"Everyone tells you why you should be learning machine learning. It is the next 'big thing' after all. But in this video I'm going to be telling you why you should NOT learn machine learning. 

There are many reasons for not starting machine learning. Some of these are:
1. Don't get into ML just because it is popular. Basically do not FOMO into it.
2. Machine learning is a huge field, there are so many things to do. You might start it but eventually give up because you don't know what exactly you want to build using ML/AI.
3. Just because you saw people getting paid more for machine learning jobs doesn't mean you should start it. As you can still polish your skills in other computer science related fields.

Even though I mention why you should not be get into machine learning, this doesn't mean that you should not at least give it a go. This video is only made for some people who want to get into ML/AI without having any major goal.

Let me know what you think about this in the comment section below.

Learn the ‚Äònew‚Äô paradigm of machine learning, and how models are an alternative implementation for some logic scenarios, as opposed to writing if/then rules and other code. This session will guide you through understanding many of the new concepts in machine learning that you might not be familiar with including eager mode, training loops, optimizers, and loss functions.

262,KNAWp2S3w94,Intro to Machine Learning (ML Zero to Hero - Part 1),Machine Learning,2019-08-30T18:22:14Z,"Machine Learning represents a new paradigm in programming, where instead of programming explicit rules in a language such as Java or C++, you build a system which is trained on data to infer the rules itself. But what does ML actually look like? In part one of Machine Learning Zero to Hero, AI Advocate Laurence Moroney (lmoroney@) walks through a basic Hello World example of building an ML model, introducing ideas which we'll apply in later episodes to a more interesting problem: computer vision.

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

There is an abundance of machine learning resources out there, too many.

The good thing is, most of them are pretty good. 

But remember, having too many options is the same as no options. Instead of trying to learn them all, pick something, use it, make something with it and if it doesn't work, move onto the next thing.

If you're stuck being a donkey, maybe the procrastination is a sign it's time to move on or find a better option.

273,7jVKwYQdKww,"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning in Telugu | Vamsi Bhavani",Machine Learning,2020-01-08T11:30:21Z,"This all began with a doubt...

AI vs ML vs DL

My doubt was why these words used interchangeably even when they are not the same. 

I came to a conclusion about this while I was going through AI vs ML vs DL which I'll be briefing in the last.

Hierarchy-

DL is subset of ML which is further a subset of AI.

DL is the way in which ML is achieved. 
ML is the way in which AI is achieved. 

AI- Artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence and trying to to make machine as intelligent as human.

This can be achieved by again mimicking the process by which by which human becomes intelligent and that is learning so here comes machine-learning which tries to make machine learn and make itself intelligent which is again a part of artificial.

So here we came across the term machine learning so machine learning was about described as making machine learn and make itself intelligent but how can we make machine learn?

Here again we go for a mimicking human by which he Learns and uses his intelligence. How does human achieve this?
He does this by or with the help of his brain how does his brain become capable of doing search extremely wonderful things that is because of the neural network in his brain which is a collection for cluster of millions and billions of neurones forming a network which are interlinked through a synapse. Show the process of making this brings a new buzzword that is data science.

So if we back forget now we will learn that data science is the way by which machine learning is achieved and machine learning is the way by which artificial intelligence is achieved as all these three are interlinked.

So There comes a obvious overlap between this three fields that is why in most of the cases which we find, we realise that these words are used interchangeably.

In the images you will find something called hardcoded stuff what I mean by it is is the basic image recognition which we do by using computer vision using open CV library openCV which does not include any kind of artificial intelligence or machine learning or data science completely. But it can be argued that they have a common overlap.

Talking about the examples.

The best example that anyone could give of artificial intelligence is is Google assistant or Siri or Cortana as you have already mentioned these I would like to add voice to text converters that uses AI.

And coming to machine learning I personally I like to give the example of stock prediction.

And for deep learning ANN- artificial neural network ard an example.

Even it can be argued that each of the examples mentioned above can be interchangeably used for examples of others like voice to text converter can be purely achieved through machine learning also.

So it is just the matter of how we realise these three and applied to our our desired need.

All of this is explained in Telugu. So, it your responsibility to share this information with other telugu mates...

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live, and it‚Äôs time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now, let us deep dive into this short video and understand the basics of Machine Learning

From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

Statistics is a form of mathematical analysis that uses quantified models, representations and synopses for a given set of experimental data or real-life studies. Statistics studies methodologies to gather, review, analyze and draw conclusions from data. A measure of central tendency is a summary statistic that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset. These measures indicate where most values in a distribution fall and are also referred to as the central location of a distribution. In statistics, the three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. Each of these measures calculates the location of the central point using a different method. Measure of dispersion shows the scatterings of the data. It tells the variation of the data from one another and gives a clear idea about the distribution of the data. The measure of dispersion shows the homogeneity or the heterogeneity of the distribution of the observations.

In this series we're going to take a look at the important role statistics play in our everyday lives, because statistics are everywhere! Statistics help us better understand the world and make decisions from what you'll wear tomorrow to government policy. But in the wrong hands, statistics can be used to misinform. So we're going to try to do two things in this series. Help show you the usefulness of statistics, but also help you become a more informed consumer of statistics. From probabilities, paradoxes, and p-values there's a lot to cover in this series, and there will be some math, but we promise only when it's most important. But first, we should talk about what statistics actually are, and what we can do with them. Statistics are tools, but they can't give us all the answers.

Statistics are persuasive. So much so that people, organizations, and whole countries base some of their most important decisions on organized data. But any set of statistics might have something lurking inside it that can turn the results completely upside down. Mark Liddell investigates Simpson‚Äôs paradox.

Grade 6th on Khan Academy: By the 6th grade, you're becoming a sophisticated mathemagician. You'll be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide any non-negative numbers (including decimals and fractions) that any grumpy ogre throws at you. Mind-blowing ideas like exponents (you saw these briefly in the 5th grade), ratios, percents, negative numbers, and variable expressions will start being in your comfort zone. Most importantly, the algebraic side of mathematics is a whole new kind of fun! And if that is not enough, we are going to continue with our understanding of ideas like the coordinate plane (from 5th grade) and area while beginning to derive meaning from data! (Content was selected for this grade level based on a typical curriculum in the United States.)

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

1a)  Yes, it is a statistical question because you would expect the                 ages of people who retire early to vary.
  b)  Cluster around 60. Peak at 60 and two gaps, one between 56 and 58 and the other between 62 and 64.  
  c)  Most people who retire early are about 60 years old.  

2a)  20 students ran the race (there are 20 data points)
  b)  You can collect these data with a stopwatch.  The units would be seconds.
  c)  Question:  ""How long does it take a sixth grade student to run 100 meters?""  Answer:  It takes most sixth graders about 13.8 seconds to run 100 meters.",943057,12169,513,0,547

Check out Audible.com: http://bit.ly/ZJ5Q6z

Is punishment or reward more effective for helping people learn. A lot of people would say different incentives motivate different people, or in different circumstances, but in psychology there is a sizable body of evidence that in order to learn skills, positive feedback is more effective. This fining has been verified not just with humans, but also with other species.

It was strange then that after Daniel Kahneman discussed this research with Israeli fighter pilot instructors that he was met with resistance. They found the opposite was true: when they reprimanded a cadet for performing poorly, he invariably improved, but if they praised a cadet for an excellent performance, the next attempt was not as good. In order to solve this apparent contradiction we first need to understand regression to the mean.

340,yDEvXB6ApWc,Confidence Intervals: Crash Course Statistics #20,Statistics,2018-06-13T20:26:19Z,"Today we‚Äôre going to talk about confidence intervals. Confidence intervals allow us to quantify our uncertainty, by allowing us to define a range of values for our predictions and assigning a likelihood that something falls within that range. And confidence intervals come up a lot like when you get delivery windows for packages, during elections when pollsters cite margin of errors, and we use them instinctively in everyday decisions. But confidence intervals also demonstrate the tradeoff of accuracy for precision - the greater our confidence, usually the less useful our range.

In this lesson, we will discuss the very important topic of p-values in statistics.  The p-value is a calculation that we make during hypothesis testing to determine if we reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it.

The p-value is calculated by first finding the z test statistic.  Once this is known we then need to find the probability of our population having a value more extreme than the test statistic.  This is done by looking up the probability in a normal distribution table.  We then interpret the results by comparing the p-value to the level of significance.

If you're looking for a complete SQL tutorial for beginners with examples, this tutorial is a great way to learn SQL basics. Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time. 

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a language used by software developers, data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL, you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information. 

There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course, we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server), you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.",3844094,97446,912,0,5776

What is a Database in MySQL in Hindi?
A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has one or more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it holds.

Nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage the huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the data is stored into different tables and relations are established using primary keys or other keys known as Foreign Keys.

A Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS) is a software that ‚àí

Enables you to implement a database with tables, columns and indexes.

Guarantees the Referential Integrity between rows of various tables.

Updates the indexes automatically.

Interprets an SQL query and combines information from various tables.

RDBMS Terminology
Before we proceed to explain the MySQL database system, let us revise a few definitions related to the database.

Database ‚àí A database is a collection of tables, with related data.

Table ‚àí A table is a matrix with data. A table in a database looks like a simple spreadsheet.

Column ‚àí One column (data element) contains data of one and the same kind, for example the column postcode.

Row ‚àí A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for example the data of one subscription.

Redundancy ‚àí Storing data twice, redundantly to make the system faster.

Primary Key ‚àí A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice in one table. With a key, you can only find one row.

Foreign Key ‚àí A foreign key is the linking pin between two tables.

Compound Key ‚àí A compound key (composite key) is a key that consists of multiple columns, because one column is not sufficiently unique.

Index ‚àí An index in a database resembles an index at the back of a book.

Referential Integrity ‚àí Referential Integrity makes sure that a foreign key value always points to an existing row.

MySQL Database
MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. MySQL is becoming so popular because of many good reasons ‚àí

MySQL is released under an open-source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it.

MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.

MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.

MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.

MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.

MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development.

MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).

MySQL is customizable. The open-source GPL license allows programmers to modify the MySQL software to fit their own specific environments.",448165,15622,370,0,949

We will cover what SQL is, why SQL is important, what SQL is used for, the syntax of SQL, and multiple examples of SQL. SQL is the standard language for interacting with and manipulating data in a relational database system, and is one of the most important concepts you can learn in programming. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data which is something nearly every application will need to do.

‚≠êWhy should you opt for a MySQL career?
MySQL can do much of the workhorse kind of stuff you see in databases like Oracle or SQL Server, but sometimes it achieves those goals in very different ways.  For instance there are many open-source projects that support and surround the database, such as mysqltuner an analysis script, innotop a unix top-like utility for monitoring on-going activity in the database, and maatkit a whole suite of tools that build on and expand the features already present in the MySQL database.

1. DML triggers 
2. DDL triggers

DML triggers are fired automatically in response to DML events (INSERT, UPDATE & DELETE). DML triggers can be again classified into 2 types
1. After triggers (Sometimes called as FOR triggers)
2. Instead of triggers. 

After triggers, fires after the triggering action. The INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, causes an after trigger to fire after the respective statements complete execution. INSTEAD of triggers, fires instead of the triggering action. The INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, causes an INSTEAD OF trigger to fire INSTEAD OF the respective statement execution.

For example, if you have a database table with a list of people, a common query would be to lookup someone by name.  Creating an index means the database will not have to scan the entire table looking for matches.  Instead, it will restrict its search to a small portion of the rows.

In this video we use a table with 100 million rows to illustrate how much an index can change the speed of a query.

427,pmpzsws4xwA,Analytical Functions in oracle explained with real examples,Oracle,2017-09-14T23:29:11Z,"This video explains analytical functions and how they are implemented in real projects.
Analytical functions are somewhat similar to aggregate functions,but they offer much more.
Why use analytical function ? They allow you to write fast and concise queries which otherwise will involve self join and long processing times 
They allow you to perform aggregate functions independently on sets of partitions. You can access values from previous rows in current row and you can restrict the window on which you want to apply this analytical function. 
I have given additional practice exercises along with the dataset so that you can comfortably work with analytical functions.
You can find the sample problems along with dataset in the below link.

Complete understanding of Oracle Database Backup and Recovery:
=========================================================
Backup:
Ground Rules for Backup and Recovery:

Types of Backup:
              1. Logical backup - Table backup                                                         
              2. Physical backup - OS files (Datafile) backup

Ways to perform backup: 
              1. User Managed
                             --- Cold Database Backup
                             --- Hot Database Backup                                                                       
              2. Recovery Manager RMAN

Backup states / Types: 
              1. Consistent Backup                                        
              2. Inconsistent Backup

Recovery: 
              1. Complete Recovery
              2. Incomplete Recovery

Performing Cold Backup and Recovery: 
Hot Database Recovery (All Datafiles were lost):
Hot Database Recovery (All Datafiles and Control files were lost):
Performing Hot Backup and Recovery (All Datafiles and Control files were lost) with Data: 

RMAN:
              - Recovery Manager
              - Oracle Database backup and recovery automation
              - It Introduced in Oracle 8i version
              - It performs block level backup
              - Parallelism

In case you don't get to configure your server during installation, simply run the installer again and choose the blue label ""Reconfigure"" next to ""MySQL Server"" Product.

Then you'll be able to go through all the steps of choosing the Authentication Method, passwords etc., just like he did in the video.

For instance, there are many open-source projects that support and surround the database, such as MySQL tuner an analysis script, into a Unix top-like utility for monitoring on-going activity in the database, and maatkit a whole suite of tools that build on and expand the features already present in the MySQL database.

Video Transcript
Time - 00:00
Hello. In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect to a MySQL database with Java. In this session we‚Äôre going to learn how to connect a MySQL database with Java. Before we get started there are some prep work that needs to take place. One is that you need to have a MySQL database already installed. If not, you can download one from the site listed here on the slide. 
 
Time - 00:20
Next, we‚Äôll need to download and install a MySQL JDBC driver. This driver will allow the Java program to connect to the database. You can download it from this URL, and I‚Äôll do that now. I‚Äôll just take this URL, drop it into my favorite browser and here I am at the page. I‚Äôm on this page, this is for downloading the Connector/J browser. I‚Äôll select the platform, platform independent. Now move down and I‚Äôll select download and it will download a zip archive. Make sure you download the most recent version. In this case it‚Äôs 5.1.29. Make sure you download something at that version or later. 

Time - 01:04
Download, scroll down, select, ‚ÄúNo thanks, just start my download.‚Äù This will start downloading the file for you. Now what we can do is show it in the finder. I‚Äôll double click it to extract it. At this point I have the driver extracted. There‚Äôs a file in here called MySQL connector.jar that we‚Äôll use later. 

Time - 01:34
Next, what I need to do is create a Java project in Eclipse. Let‚Äôs do that. On Eclipse I‚Äôll say I‚Äôll save file, new, Java project. This will be JDBC demo and I will select finish. What I‚Äôll do is I will add a new class. New, class, this will be my driver and it will have a public static void main region. At this point we have a shell for our project created.  

Time - 02:28
Next, what we‚Äôll do is we will talk to the actual development process and I really like this slide because it outlines exactly what we need to do. The first thing we‚Äôll do is add the database driver to the classpath. Next, we‚Äôll get a connection, we‚Äôll submit a SQL query and then we‚Äôll process the result set. 

Time - 02:48
Let‚Äôs start with step one, adding a MySQL database driver to the classpath. In our Eclipse project I‚Äôm going to add a new folder called lib, lib for library. In this lib folder I‚Äôm going to add the driver that I downloaded earlier. What I‚Äôll do is I‚Äôll just grab this driver. It‚Äôs the MySQL connector bin.jar and I‚Äôll just drag and drop it to this lib folder. It will prompt me and I‚Äôll say go ahead and copy the file. 

Time - 03:25
Next, I need to add the jar file, the driver to the classpath. I‚Äôve set this up with properties, choose Java build path and then I‚Äôll choose add jars. Expand this folder, that lib, I‚Äôll grab that jar file and I‚Äôll have it setup. Great.

Time - 03:51
Now we can start coding. We need to get a connection, submit a SQL query and process a result set. Let me just sketch this out on a slide over here. The first thing I‚Äôll do up top is I‚Äôll just do an import on java.sql.* because all of the classes and interfaces that we need are in this package. 

Time -  04:17
I‚Äôll also just setup a try catch block just to handle for any exception that may occur. Small typo there. 

Time - 04:40
Inside of this section I‚Äôm going to first get a connection to database. Then next I will create a statement. Then from here I will execute a SQL query and then I will process the result set. 
Time - 05:16
That‚Äôs my basic game plan, let‚Äôs fill it in with some real code. Here I‚Äôll say connection, myConn = DriverManager.getConnection. I‚Äôll give the jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo student, student. Student is the user ID and student is also the password.

A confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, uses a special table to help visualize the performance of your algorithm.  That way, you can easily see how successful your model was when predicting the class.

Topics include: true positives and negatives, target classes, and predictive models.

495,CYy0TZ6OIDw,Machine Learning Basics: Confusion Matrix &amp; Precision/Recall Simplified | By Dr. Ry @Stemplicity,Confusion Matrix,2019-06-27T23:42:08Z,"This tutorial covers the basics of confusion matrix which is used to describe the performance of classification models. 

The tutorial will also cover the difference between True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives which can be described as follows: 

‚Ä¢ True positives (TP): cases when classifier predicted TRUE (they have the disease), and correct class was TRUE (patient has disease).

‚Ä¢ True negatives (TN): cases when model predicted FALSE (no disease), and correct class was FALSE (patient do not have disease).

‚Ä¢ False positives (FP) (Type I error): classifier predicted TRUE, but correct class was FALSE (patient did not have disease). 

‚Ä¢ False negatives (FN) (Type II error): classifier predicted FALSE (patient do not have disease), but they actually do have the disease

The tutorial will also cover the difference between classification accuracy, error rate, precision and recall. These metrics can be summarized as shown below:

‚Ä¢ Classification Accuracy = (TP+TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
‚Ä¢ Misclassification rate (Error Rate) = (FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
‚Ä¢ Precision = TP/Total TRUE Predictions = TP/ (TP+FP) (When model predicted TRUE class, how often was it right?)
‚Ä¢ Recall = TP/ Actual TRUE = TP/ (TP+FN) (when the class was actually TRUE, how often did the classifier get it right?)

A confusion matrix (python sklearn: https://youtu.be/Ihq-w9MW6Nc) is a technique for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm. Classification accuracy alone can be misleading if you have an unequal number of observations in each class or if you have more than two classes in your dataset. Calculating a confusion matrix can give you a better idea of what your classification model is getting right and what types of errors it is making. In this video, you will discover the confusion matrix for use in machine learning.

Part 2 - Visualize Confusion Matrix of Different Order

a. using Sklearn's make_classification we will create our own dataset
b. use Logistic Regression model to predict the classification o/p
c. generate heatmap visualisation for Confusion_matrix.

Code Starts Here
==============

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

522,nlwvdWzHkLQ,Machine Learning From Scratch - Cross Validation And Confusion Matrix,Confusion Matrix,2020-06-20T18:53:55Z,"Cross Validation In machine learning is a good way to evaluate a model is to use cross validation. cross_val_score() function is used to get the cross validation of the model. At each iteration the code creates a clone of the classifier, train that clone of the training folds and make prediction on the test fold. Then it counts the number of correct prediction and output the ratio of correct prediction. Remember that K-fold cross validation means splitting training set into into K-folds(in this case three). Then making prediction and evaluating them on each fold using a model on the remaining folds.


Confusion Matrix in machine learning is the square contingency matrix where the rows and columns correspond to a list of classes. It is used to evaluate the accuracy of classification. Sometimes it is called error matrix. By definition entry x and y in confusion matrix, is the number of observation actually in group x, but predicted to be in group y.

Confusion Matrix - True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative - P1

The Confusion matrix is one of the most simple and easiest metrics used for finding the correctness and accuracy of the Classification model.

Classsification is the Supervised ML technique where we will predict the class.
For example 
1. In case of Titanic Dataset we predict whether the person survives or is dead
2. also in case of Iris dataset we will predict the species of flower
3. In case for email we can predict whether its a spam mail, genuine, social or promotions 

Confusion Matrix
In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, 
is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one 

Each column of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each row represents the instances 
in an actual class (or vice versa). The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see if the system is confusing two classes 
(i.e. commonly mislabeling one as another).

530,Jc4s_7EIybU,Confusion Matrix for Binary Classification || Lesson 45 || Machine Learning || Learning Monkey ||,Confusion Matrix,2020-04-22T13:24:54Z,"#machinelearning#learningmonkey

In this class, we will discuss the Confusion Matrix for Binary Classification.
Confusion matrix for binary classification helps a lot in understanding ROC Curve

The confusion matrix is developed using actual outputs and predicted outputs.

Let's take an example data set in binary classification.

Cancer prediction data set.

if a patient had cancer he is given value 1, which means positive.

If a patient doesn't have cancer he is given value 0, which means negative.

If the patient is having a positive ie actual positive. and our model predicted as positive.

we call them true positive.

If the patient has negative, and our model predicts negative. we call the true negative.

if the patient has positive, and our model predicts as negative. we call the false negative.

If the patient has negative, and our model predicts as positive. we call false positive.

True positive rate = No of true positive/total positive data points

True negative rate = No of true negative/total negative data points.

False-negative rate = No of false-negative/total positive data points

False-positive rate= No of false-positive/Total Negative data points

Recall = TPR( True positive rate)

Precision = No of true positive / Total predicted positive data points

From the above equations, we observe that True negative rate = 1 - False positive rate.

The above equation is very important in understanding ROC_AUC in our next class.

As a false positive rate is decreasing the true negative rate increasing. and vice-versa.

The same applies to the true positive rate and false-negative rate.

False-negative rate decreasing true positive rate increasing and vice versa.

To display this evaluation. In sklearn there is a separate class called a confusion matrix.

This class will take input as actual values and predicted values.

Based on that it will generate the confusion matrix and we use this extensively in our machine learning.

546,1oeoosMrJz4,Ten risks associated with Artificial Intelligence | AI Ethics,Arificial Intelligence,2018-03-07T16:53:14Z,"How dangerous could artificial intelligence turn out to be, and how do we develop ethical AI?

Risk Bites dives into AI risk and AI ethics, with ten potential risks of AI we should probably be paying attention to now, if we want to develop the technology safely, ethically, and beneficially, while avoiding the dangers. With author of Films from the Future and ASU professor Andrew Maynard.        

Although the video doesn't include the jargon usually associated with AI risk and responsible innovation, the ten risks listed address:

0:00 Introduction
1:07 Technological dependency
1:25  Job replacement and redistribution
1:43  Algorithmic bias
2:03  Non-transparent decision making
2:27  Value-misalignment
2:44  Lethal Autonomous Weapons
2:59  Re-writable goals
3:11  Unintended consequences of goals and decisions
3:31  Existential risk from superintelligence
3:51 Heuristic manipulation

There are many other potential risks associated with AI, but as always with risk, the more important questions are associated with the nature, context, type of impact, and magnitude of impact of the risks; together with relevant benefits and tradeoffs. 

The video is part of Risk Bites series on Public Interest Technology - technology in the service of public good.

Something incredible has taken place in the past 5 years: a revolution in artificial intelligence. After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs. In this video we sort out the fact from fiction in this very exciting field.

You probably don't see AI at work, and that's by design. AI is changing everything. But do we want it to?

[dt-video-embed id=""2261033"" ]

In the last decade, artificial intelligence has gone from a science fiction dream to a critical part of our everyday lives. We use AI systems to interact with our phones through Siri and Alexa, cars like Teslas interpret and analyze their surroundings to intelligently drive themselves, Amazon monitors our browsing habits and intelligently serves us up products it thinks we‚Äôd like to buy, and even Google decides what kinds of search results to give us based on who it thinks we are. Artificially intelligent algorithms are here, they‚Äôve already changed our lives for better or worse. But this is only the beginning, and one day we‚Äôll look back at AI in 2018 and laugh about how primitive it was. Because in the future, AI is going to change‚Ä¶ everything. But do we want it to?

Well, what exactly is AI? Maybe a better question might be: what exactly is ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù? The simplest descriptor is collecting data about the world, and using that data to make predictions in the short and long term. That applies to both people and machines. So when we talk about AI in our lives, we‚Äôre talking about everything from a computer being able to read a handwritten document, like an OCR reader, to a robot performing complex surgery on its own, to a massive database categorizing your personality based on what you‚Äôve written and looked at online. Because the world of AI is so incredibly large, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the most groundbreaking developments we expect to see in the very near future, and whether that‚Äôs a step forward or backward for society.

First and foremost, AI systems are already primed to take over thousands, if not millions of jobs. Any job that consists of a human taking down information from other humans, and inputting it into a system is likely to go obsolete. So cashiers, receptionists, telemarketers and bank tellers are all on their way out. As self-driving cars, self-operating drones, and other conveyors from A-to-B get more complex, we‚Äôll also lose jobs like truck drivers, postal workers, courier services, and even pizza delivery. Factories are also becoming fully automated, so are car washes, and movie theaters. Even my job, as a journalist, is threatened by rapidly improving news algorithms that can gather information and deliver it faster, and more accurately.

As we develop better AI, we‚Äôre discovering that it can not just replace human labor, but also think in ways that humans can‚Äôt. Algorithms that can monitor and process massive amounts of data, and make conclusions based on patterns in that data are poised to change every avenue of society. Starting from something small, like optimizing traffic patterns over time to figure out the best routes to take, or how to fix roads and rebuild highways. To something much more serious, like monitoring epidemics and disease, and stopping them before they spread. Machine learning has even shown to analyze human behavior, and predict warning signs by recognizing common language used by people like sexual predators or terrorists, and alerting law enforcement to take action. Then again, that same technology can be used to track down political dissidents, or serve fake news to vulnerable people while blocking out competing opinions and information.

The more we study and develop artificial intelligence, the clearer it becomes that this massively powerful tool comes with a great deal of responsibility. As futurists try to plan out a rapidly changing and advancing world, the biggest hurdle isn‚Äôt technological, but economic and political. Just a few tech monopolies control the latest breakthroughs in data collecting, processing, and analyzing - and while we may hope that AI will help advance our society, it may just end up working to benefit the tech industry and only those who can afford to take advantage of cheaper, smarter human replacements - maybe.. to the detriment of society. For now, we just don‚Äôt know what the future holds..

563,cRr9S9Vnxvc,The Top Artificial Intelligence Companies To Watch In 2021 | Forbes,Arificial Intelligence,2021-04-27T20:45:00Z,"The Covid-19 pandemic was devastating for many industries, but it only accelerated the use of artificial intelligence across the U.S. economy. Amid the crisis, companies scrambled to create new services for remote workers and students, beef up online shopping and dining options, make customer call centers more efficient and speed development of important new drugs. 

Even as applications of machine learning and perception platforms become commonplace, a thick layer of hype and fuzzy jargon clings to AI-enabled software.That makes it tough to identify the most compelling companies in the space‚Äîespecially those finding new ways to use AI that create value by making humans more efficient, not redundant.

With this in mind, Forbes has partnered with venture firms Sequoia Capital and Meritech Capital to create our third annual AI 50, a list of private, promising North American companies that are using artificial intelligence in ways that are fundamental to their operations. To be considered, businesses must be privately-held and utilizing machine learning (where systems learn from data to improve on tasks), natural language processing (which enables programs to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù written or spoken language) or computer vision (which relates to how machines ‚Äúsee‚Äù). AI companies incubated at, largely funded through or acquired by large tech, manufacturing or industrial firms aren‚Äôt eligible for consideration.

Our list was compiled through a submission process open to any AI company in the U.S. and Canada. The application asked companies to provide details on their technology, business model, customers and financials like funding, valuation and revenue history (companies had the option to submit information confidentially, to encourage greater transparency). Forbes received several hundred entries, of which nearly 400 qualified for consideration. From there, our data partners applied an algorithm to identify 100 companies with the highest quantitative scores‚Äîand that also made diversity a priority. Next, a panel of expert AI judges evaluated the finalists to find the 50 most compelling companies (they were precluded from judging companies in which they have a vested interest).

freeing up time for creativity and innovative thinking
through artificial intelligence (AI). Chris Boos has a mission: empowering human potential, freeing up time for creativity and innovative thinking through artificial intelligence (AI). To that end, Chris founded Arago in Germany in 1995, pushing existing boundaries in AI technology to build a general AI. Since then, Chris has led Arago to become a key partner and driver for the established economy. But his ambitions go far beyond: a strong believer in integrating machine reasoning and machine learning, Chris is constantly challenging current thinking on AI. As a strategic corporate and political advisor, as well as angel investor, Chris‚Äô multifaceted engagement for AI makes him a much respected public speaker and thought-leader on issues of global importance, such as the man-machine-relationship, the way societies deal with information and the future of labor.

This will be the first attempt to define a comprehensive regulatory framework for AI, dealing with essential aspects such as the definition of high-risk applications, regulatory obligations for providers of AI systems, the post-market surveillance of AI, the conformity assessment of high-risk AI applications and the possible creation of a new AI Board. This will be a very ambitious proposal, which has been expected for several months also outside the EU, where several countries are considering regulating specific uses of AI. CEPS has therefore decided to invite the Director for AI and Digital Industry at the European Commission DG CONNECT, Lucilla Sioli, for an informal debate followed by a round of first impressions on the content of the proposal.",2089,35,0,0,7

Artificial intelligence has been a topic of growing prominence in the media and mainstream culture since 2015, as well as in the investment world, with start-ups that even mention the word in their business model, gaining massive amounts of funding.

While to many, the hype around AI may appear sudden, the concepts of modern artificial intelligence have been around for over a century and extending further, the concept of artificial intelligence and artificial beings have been in the minds of humans for thousands of years.

To better understand and appreciate this technology and those who brought it to us as well as to gain insight into where it will take us: sit back, relax and join me in an exploration on the history of artificial intelligence.

NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

Who is the data analyst exactly?
Data analysts are the real troopers of data science. They‚Äôre the ones who are involved in gathering data, structuring databases, creating and running models, and preparing advanced types of analyses to explain the patterns in the data that have already emerged. A data analyst also overlooks the basic part of predictive analytics.

That‚Äôs the ‚Äúelevator pitch of the data analyst‚Äù. But to really get an idea of what it means to be part of a team like that, we need to look at what a data analyst does. 

As it turns out, quite a lot. A data analyst is both a thinker and a doer who doesn‚Äôt hesitate to roll up their sleeves and dig into the numbers. Data analysts extract and analyze data with a ‚Äúcan do‚Äù approach and then present data-driven insights to underpin decision making. They also develop and build analytics models and approaches as the basis for a company‚Äôs strategy and vision. On top of that, they are often responsible for identifying and extracting key business performance, risk and compliance data, and converting it into easy-to-digest formats. So, as you can see, agility to shift between strategic projects and operational activities a must.

If you think that sounds a bit lonely‚Ä¶ Think again! Data analysts are great team players and work closely with various departments and leaders within the organization. That‚Äôs super important if they want to be effective in this role. So, the ability to communicate well and influence is critical here‚Ä¶

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

623,ulk_JWckJ78,Choosing a Statistical Test for Your IB Biology IA,Statistical Analysis,2019-02-17T21:58:10Z,"CORRECTION AT 8:51: in the chart, 'Wilcoxon' and 'Mann Whitney' should be switched. Wilcoxon is the non-parametric version of the PAIRED t-test (not unpaired as the video suggests). Mann Whitney is the non-parametric version of the UNPAIRED t-test (not paired as the video suggests).

One small caveat: in broader mathematics, ""number of bacterial colonies"" would be treated as a **discrete variable**, which means the variable is numeric but it's restricted to certain values (and between those allowable values are gaps that the variable can't take on). But if you're plugging that variable into a regression or t-test/ANOVA model, then you're treating it as continuous. To quote minitab, which has great articles on statistics:

""If you have a discrete variable and you want to include it in a Regression or ANOVA model, you can decide whether to treat it as a continuous predictor (covariate) or categorical predictor (factor). If the discrete variable has many levels, then it may be best to treat it as a continuous variable. Treating a predictor as a continuous variable implies that a simple linear or polynomial function can adequately describe the relationship between the response and the predictor. When you treat a predictor as a categorical variable, a distinct response value is fit to each level of the variable without regard to the order of the predictor levels. Use this information, in addition to the purpose of your analysis to decide what is best for your situation.""

https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab-express/1/help-and-how-to/modeling-statistics/regression/supporting-topics/basics/what-are-categorical-discrete-and-continuous-variables/

One big caveat: some may take issue with the terms 'relationship' and 'comparison' and the way I'm using them. Consider a medical researcher who is testing a new drug by comparing a treatment group with a placebo group. She might say: ""the video says I'm doing a *comparison* of two groups. But I disagree; I believe I'm seeking a relationship/correlation between the drug and the therapeutic effect."" So who is right--the video or the medical researcher? The fact is that comparisons can allow us to deduce relationships, and this creates ambiguity. In the video, the term 'relationship' perhaps should be interpreted very narrowly to mean: 'you're seeking a mathematical equation that relates the variables.' And the term 'correlation' should be interpreted narrowly to mean: 'you're seeking a number showing how correlated your two variables are.' These terms (comparison & relationship) describe what you're doing with the data and variables themselves, not the larger goals of the experiment.

Nothing can replace practice; the more you use these tests, the more you'll understand how they apply and what their limitations are. I'm not an expert on statistical tests. If you find other good explanations or sources that go into subtleties that the video overlooks, please share them in the comments!",208828,6003,50,0,149

Our word of the day is ‚ÄúStatistical Analysis‚Äù
Within the finance industry, statistical analysis remains a significant tool in measuring price movements of a security over time. In the forex market, technical indicators are used to identify patterns that can help predict future price movements. The principle that history repeats itself is fundamental to technical analysis. Since the FX markets operate 24 hours per day, the robust amount of information thereby increases the statistical significance of forecasts. Due to the increasing sophistication of computer programs, algorithms have been generated in accordance to technical indicators, including moving average convergence divergence known as MACD and relative strength index or RSI. Algorithmic programs suggest particular times at which currencies should be bought or sold.

In this video, we will talk about Statistics for Data Science using R programming language, more specifically about the types of Statistical methods, different statistical measures and categorization of Descriptive Statistics.

What is Statistics?
Statistics is a form of mathematical analysis that uses quantified models, representations and synopses for a given set of experimental or real-life data. Statistics studies methodologies to gather, review, analyze and draw conclusions from data. 

There are many different types of statistics pertaining to which situation you need to analyze. Statistics are used to make better business decisions

Statistical Measures
Some statistical measures include the following:
‚Ä¢ Mean
‚Ä¢ Regression analysis
‚Ä¢ Skewness
‚Ä¢ Variance
‚Ä¢ Analysis of variance

Mean
A mean is the mathematical average of a group of two or more numerals. The mean for a specified set of numbers can be computed in multiple ways, including the arithmetic mean, which shows how well a specific commodity performs over time, and the geometric mean, which shows the performance results of an investor‚Äôs portfolio invested in that same commodity over the same period.

Regression Analysis
The regression analysis determines the extent to which specific factors such as interest rates, the price of a product, influence the price fluctuations of an asset. This is depicted in the form of a straight line called linear regression.

Skewness
Skewness describes the degree a set of data varies from the standard distribution in a set of statistical data. Most data sets, including commodity returns and stock prices, have either positive skew or negative skew.

Variance
Variance is a measurement of the span of numbers in a data set. The variance measures the distance each number in the set is from the mean. Variance can help determine the risk an investor might accept when buying an investment.

Understanding Statistics
Statistics is a term used to summarize a process that an analyst uses to characterize a data set. Statistical analysis involves the process of gathering and evaluating data and then summarizing the data into a mathematical form.

Statistics is used in various disciplines such as business, social sciences, etc. Two types of statistical methods are used in analyzing data: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. 

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize data from a sample exercising the mean or standard deviation. Inferential statistics are used when data is viewed as a subclass of a specific population.

What is Descriptive Statistics?
Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population. 

Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread). 

Measures of central tendency focus on the average or middle values of data sets; whereas, measures of variability focus on the dispersion of data. These two measures use graphs, tables, and general discussions to help people understand the meaning of the analyzed data.

Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode. Measures of central tendency describe the centre position of a distribution for a data set. A person analyzes the frequency of each data point in the distribution and describes it using the mean, median, or mode, which measures the most common patterns of the analyzed data set.

Measures of variability include the standard deviation, variance, the minimum and maximum variables, and skewness. Measures of variability, or the measures of spread, aid in analyzing how spread-out the distribution is for a set of data. For example, while the measures of central tendency may give a person the average of a data set, it does not describe how the data is distributed within the set. 

Inferential Statistics:
P-Value in Statistical Hypothesis
Degrees of Freedom
Confidence Interval
Hypothesis Testing
Chi-square Test

Transcript/notes
What is statistics?  Well, it is the science of collecting, organizing, summarizing and interpreting data. For instance, according to the U.S. Department of Health and human services website, less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day, children spend more than 7 and a half hours a day in front of a screen, for 2 to 18 year olds, 40% of their total daily calories come from added sugars and solid fats.  All of these numbers come from data and statistical analysis of this data.

And what statistics actually does is gives us, people, a way to make an informed decisions. For example, if you have ever bought something on Amazon, you probably look at the star ratings.  If you find 2 similar versions of a product you want, say a camera lens, you look at the price of each, then how many overall stars it has, then maybe the distribution of the ratings, and how many total ratings it has, and maybe read a few of the highest and lowest reviews about the lens.  

Then you are going to look at the sellers of the lens and check their ratings, and then you check out the delivery time till you have the product in your hands.  In this scenario, you would have done a very quick and informal statistical analysis.

In learning about statistics, there are some important terms to have a basic understanding of. 

An Individual also called an element is a person or object included in a study.

Variable is characteristic of the individual being measured or observed, which varies from individual to individual, so for instance, this could be occupation, income, age, education.

Observation is a value that is observed for a variable, which is also called a measurement.  And a person can actually be an observation as can a certain product or even a set period in time.  

Data is a piece of information, or pieces of information, or the values or measurements of a variable collected on individuals.  For individual 1 these would be electrician, $62,000, 41 years old, and technical school.  All of these would be observations for each of the different variables.

Data set is a collection data, so this table lists the individuals, the variables and each of the observations for each of the individuals.  This little table here would be considered a data set.

Folks, this is the first video in a series of videos I will be posting about understanding statistics.",29888,281,13,0,6

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks, spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

This course was created to make deep learning accessible to as many people as possible. The only prerequisite for this course is that you know how to code (a year of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed a high school math course.

This course was developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. Jeremy has been using and teaching machine learning for around 30 years. He is the former president of Kaggle, the world's largest machine learning community. Sylvain Gugger is a researcher who has written 10 math textbooks.

We will use insurance dataset as a sample and build a logistic regression. Logistic regression uses two step process for classification,
step 1: linear regression to find best fit line for given dataset
step 2: sigmoid or logit function to convert this line into values between 0 and 1
Using sigmoid function one can do a classification.

Today, we're going to combine the artificial neuron we created last week into an artificial neural network. Artificial neural networks are better than other methods for more complicated tasks like image recognition, and the key to their success is their hidden layers. We'll talk about how the math of these networks work and how using many hidden layers allows us to do deep learning. Neural networks are really powerful at finding patterns in data which is why they've become one of the most dominant machine learning technologies used today.

Hello and welcome to Acadgild‚Äôs tutorial on data science.
In this video, we explain the difference between three key concepts artificial intelligence vs machine learning vs deep learning ‚Äì to understand how they relate to the field of data science.

First up, artificial intelligence or AI! What is it?
Artificial intelligence is simply any code, technique or algorithm that enables machines to mimic, develop and demonstrate human cognition or behavior.

We are in, what many refer to as, the era of ‚Äúweak AI‚Äù. The technology is still in its infancy and is expected to make machines capable of doing anything and everything humans do, in the era of ‚Äústrong AI‚Äù.
To transition from weak AI to strong AI, machines need to learn the ways of humans. The techniques and processes, which help machines in this endeavor are broadly categorized under machine learning.
Machines learn in predominantly two ways. Their learning is either supervised or unsupervised.
In supervised learning, machines learn to predict outcomes with help from data scientists.
In unsupervised learning, machines learn to predict outcomes on the go by recognizing patterns in input data.

When machines can draw meaningful inferences from large volumes of data sets, they demonstrate the ability to learn deeply.
Deep learning requires artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are like the biological neural networks in humans. These networks contain nodes in different layers that are connected and communicate with each other to make sense of voluminous input data.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which in turn, is a subset of artificial intelligence.
The three technologies help scientists and analysts interpret tons of data and are hence crucial for the field of data science.
To learn more about these technologies, subscribe to Acadgild‚Äôs blog and Youtube channel. To become an expert, join one of our courses.
Thank you for watching and happy learning!

""This is apt for everyone‚Äù

---------------------------------


Why Learn Natural Language Processing or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

As computers play an increasing role in our daily lives there has been an growing demand for voice user interfaces, but speech is also terribly complicated. Vocabularies are diverse, sentence structures can often dictate the meaning of certain words, and computers also have to deal with accents, mispronunciations, and many common linguistic faux pas. The field of Natural Language Processing, or NLP, attempts to solve these problems, with a number of techniques we‚Äôll discuss today. And even though our virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Home, Bixby, and Cortana have come a long way from the first speech processing and synthesis models, there is still much room for improvement.

Natural language processing (NLP) is an exciting branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows machines to break down and understand human language. As a data scientist, I often use NLP techniques to interpret text data that I'm working with for my analysis. During this tutorial, I plan to walk through text pre-processing techniques, machine learning techniques and Python libraries for NLP.

Text pre-processing techniques include tokenization, text normalization and data cleaning. Once in a standard format, various machine learning techniques can be applied to better understand the data. This includes using popular modeling techniques to classify emails as spam or not, or to score the sentiment of a tweet on Twitter. Newer, more complex techniques can also be used such as topic modeling, word embeddings or text generation with deep learning.

We will walk through an example in Jupyter Notebook that goes through all of the steps of a text analysis project, using several NLP libraries in Python including NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy and gensim along with the standard machine learning libraries including pandas and scikit-learn.

Why Learn Natural Language Processing  or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

So far in this series, we've mostly focused on how AI can interpret images, but one of the most common ways we interact with computers is through language - we type questions into search engines, use our smart assistants like Siri and Alexa to set alarms and check the weather, and communicate across language barriers with the help of Google Translate. Today, we're going to talk about Natural Language Processing, or NLP, show you some strategies computers can use to better understand language like distributional semantics, and then we'll introduce you to a type of neural network called a Recurrent Neural Network or RNN to build sentences.

Natural Language Processing also is known as NLP is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the interaction between the computer and humans using the natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to meet, understand, and make sense of the human language. Keeping all the things in mind we have come up with this Natural Language Processing in Artificial Intelligence Full Course

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP helps developers to organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks like translation, summarization, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, speech recognition, topic segmentation, etc. NLP is a way of computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human languages such as English, Spanish, Hindi, etc.

NLP analyzes text and allows machines to understand how we speak. It considers the hierarchical structure of language and performs tasks like correcting the grammar, converting speech to text, and translating between languages. In this tutorial, we have covered everything right from What is NLP, What are its challenges to Sentence Segmentation, RNN and LSTM, and much more, that will help you to understand this concept with ease.

Following pointers will be covered in this video:

The goal of deep learning is to explore how computers can take advantage of data to develop features and representations appropriate for complex interpretation tasks. This tutorial aims to cover the basic motivation, ideas, models and learning algorithms in deep learning for natural language processing. Recently, these methods have been shown to perform very well on various NLP tasks such as language modeling, POS tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection, among others. The most attractive quality of these techniques is that they can perform well without any external hand-designed resources or time-intensive feature engineering. Despite these advantages, many researchers in NLP are not familiar with these methods. Our focus is on insight and understanding, using graphical illustrations and simple, intuitive derivations.",24458,225,13,0,3

‚ÄúNatural Language Understanding and Conversational AI‚Äù

Natural language processing (NLP) has made dramatic advances over the last three years, ranging from deep generative models for text-to-speech, such as WaveNet, through the extensive deployment of deep contextual language models, such as BERT. Pre-training with models like BERT has significantly raised the performance of almost all NLP tasks, allowed much better domain adaptation, and brought us human-level performance for tasks like answering straightforward factual questions. New neural language models have also brought much more fluent language generation. On the one hand, we should not be too impressed by these linguistic savants: Things like understanding the consequences of events in a story or performing common sense reasoning remain out of reach. But on the other hand, I will discuss how we now live in an era where there are many good commercial uses of NLP, with much of the heavy lifting already done in the construction of large but downloadable models. I present some of our work on understanding how these models learn to be so proficient, and how we can build new types of pre-trained models that are much more compute efficient. Finally, I turn to conversational agents, where neural models can produce accurate task-based dialog agents and more effective open domain social bots.

742,7GEq-QLAGbE,Stanford Seminar - Natural Language Processing for Production-Level Conversational Interfaces,Natural language processing,2019-03-19T18:56:22Z,"Karthik Raghunathan and Arushi Raghuvanshi
Cisco Systems
March 13, 2019

Conversational applications often are over-hyped and under perform. While there's been significant progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in academia and a huge growing market for voice based technologies, NLU performance significantly drops when you introduce language with typos or other errors, uncommon vocabulary, and more complex requests. This talk will cover how to build a production quality conversational app that performs well in a real world setting.

We will demonstrate an end-to-end approach for consistently building conversational interfaces with production-level accuracies that has proven to work well for a number of applications across diverse verticals. Building successful conversational interfaces involves choosing the right use case, collecting clean and relevant data, and breaking down the NLU problem into a series of solvable sub-tasks. All of today's most widely used conversational services have been built using a similar hierarchical NLU pipeline of domain-intent-entity classification that has become an industry standard, which we will discuss in detail.

Our architecture further improves on this standard domain-intent-entity classification and dialogue management architecture by leveraging shallow semantic parsing. We observed that NLU systems for industry applications often require more structured representations of entity relations than provided by the standard hierarchy, yet without requiring full semantic or syntactic parses which are often inaccurate on real-world conversational data. We describe our approach and demonstrate how it improves the performance of conversational interfaces for non-trivial use cases.

We end the talk by discussing the additional challenges in building a voice assistant rather than a text-based chatbot. Large vocabulary domain-agnostic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often mis-transcribe domain-specific words and phrases. Since these generic ASR systems are the first components of most voice assistants in production, building NLU systems that are robust to these errors can be a challenging task. We describe a few potential methods for handling ASR errors in the NLU pipeline, especially in the entity classification and resolution component which is most susceptible to poor performance from ASR errors.

After this talk, attendees will have a better appreciation for the challenges and nuances of building real-world NLU systems, as well as a high level understanding of the best practices and components needed to build their own production quality conversational assistant.",2240,30,1,0,4

Feature engineering is a process of taking unrefined raw data and transforming it in meaningful way such that model can understand the data better

Logic on how to transform a model can come from Domain understanding of the business or Data Analysis or EDA cycle 

3 key benefits of feature engineering include

- Feature engineering can keep your model simple. As simpler algorithm can fine better pattern in data

- Provide better explain-ability 

- Remove human bias by modelling some critical data proxies as unbiased features",5330,128,2,0,24

Scott Clendaniel,Feature Engineering,2020-06-08T15:42:55Z,"While beginners often focus on algorithm selection, professionals know that the real power in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is often Feature Engineering. Unfortunately, this process can be incredibly time-consuming and complicated. This training will give you a robust set of Tips and Tricks to get the most performance in the shortest time, regardless of the algorithm you choose.

T. Scott Clendaniel has been a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence since the mid-1980‚Äôs, successfully producing results for organizations like Audi, Booz Allen Hamilton, Citicorp, Morgan Stanley and the Los Angeles Times. His approach to making the complex clear has led him to almost 37K LinkedIn followers and fans around the globe.",2806,87,2,0,5
755,ikKfP7KbZW4,Introduction to Feature Engineering in Data Science,Feature Engineering,2019-12-27T19:27:31Z,"Feature engineering is a critical task that data scientists have to perform prior to training the AI/ML models.

As a data scientist, you may need to:
- Highlight important information in the data 
- Remove/isolate unnecessary information (e.x.: outliers). 
- Add your own expertise and domain knowledge to the alter the data. 

Feature engineering is an art of introducing new features that weren‚Äôt existing before.

Data scientists spend 80% of their time performing feature engineering. The remaining 20% is the easy part which includes training the model and performing hyper parameters optimization. 

Performing proper feature engineering is crucial to improve AI/ML model performance.

As a data scientist, you need to answer the following questions:
- What are the capabilities of the ML model I have?
- Which features should I select?
- Can I add my domain knowledge to use less features?
- Can I come up with new features from the data I have at hand?
- What should I put in the missing data locations? 

It is important to choose features that are most relevant to the problem. 

Adding new features that are unnecessary will increase the computational requirements needed to train the model (curse of dimensionality).

767,hvflqHTWXVs,Financial Data Science &amp; Feature Engineering | Dr. Ernest P. Chan | Quantra by QuanInsti,Feature Engineering,2020-01-08T12:20:06Z,"FREE PREVIEW: https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/financial-data-science-feature-engineering

This is Ernest Chan, managing member of QTS Capital Management, LLC, a commodity pool operator and trading advisor. Prior to this, I have worked at IBM's Human Language Technologies group and Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining group, where I consulted for other business units within the bank. 
In the early stage of my career, one mistake that I made while creating trading strategies and deploying machine learning algorithms was I didn‚Äôt paid enough attention to data quality. As a result, the outcome was suboptimal. 

For example, if you want to predict the next day‚Äôs stock returns using five years of stock data, you can‚Äôt directly feed the raw price data to the machine learning algorithms. Raw data has several issues such as survivorship bias, duplicates, and non-stationarity. For instance, say during the dotcom bubble we bought every technology stock that currently is still being traded. That strategy would have done fabulously well, but in reality lots of the technology stocks would have gone bankrupt and disappeared from the current data set! 
So it is important to preprocess the data and make data suitable for backtesting. The process of preparing financial data for analysis by is called financial data science. 

In an article on data challenges in AI projects, IBM‚Äôs senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software said: ‚Äúabout 80% of the work with an AI project is in collecting and preparing data‚Äù. Evaluate your own AI projects. How much time have you spent preparing your data? After preprocessing the data, you can use it for analysis. 
The preprocessed data is use to create features and labels that are fed to machine learning algorithms. Features can be daily returns of the stock data, technical indicators, bid-ask spread, daily volume, and so forth. 
Features should represent the factors which affect the prediction results. If you create bad features, you won‚Äôt get good prediction results no matter how great your machine learning algorithm is. The process of creating features using the preprocessed data is called feature engineering. 

This is my fourth course exclusively on Quantra‚Äôs website in collaboration with the QuantInsti team. I am excited to talk about the different aspects of financial data science which I have learned over the years. Quantra portal makes learning easy and interactive. 
You won‚Äôt need to download and install any packages or software. You can also take a free preview and experience the portal yourself. You can take this course even if you don‚Äôt have any machine learning experience. 

The financial data cleaning steps will help you improve almost all kinds of trading models: based on econometric models, sentiment analysis, machine learning or those based on fundamental data. Some working knowledge of python or spreadsheets is required for you to implement these techniques with actual data. Through the course, you will gain essential knowledge of financial data science which can be used either in your personal trading or in an institutional setting. 

Preprocessing of financial dataset is essential to make it suitable for analysis. Extracting features from the datasets to feed into the machine learning algorithms, and setting the target variable for a particular ML problem are the crucial aspects of any machine learning or financial data science project. If data preprocessing and feature engineering is done correctly, it increases the predictive power of your algorithm and helps in achieving good accuracy. 
I hope you enjoy learning on Quantra! Good luck.

The video further goes into the mechanics of how feature extraction is done, like the process of sentence segmentation, and discusses the various facets of the process and pain points in manually setting up such a procedure. The video explains the application of the NLTK library for python which does the heavy lifting for feature engineering of text.

772,A3gClkblXK8,Outlier detection and removal using IQR | Feature engineering tutorial python # 4,Feature Engineering,2020-05-29T12:30:02Z,"IQR is another technique that one can use to detect and remove outliers. The formula for IQR is very simple. IQR = Q3-Q1. Where Q3 is 75th percentile and Q1 is 25th percentile. Once you have IQR you can find upper and lower limit by removing this formula,
lower_limit = Q1-1.5*IQR
upper_limit = Q3 +1.5*IQR
Anything less than a lower limit or above the upper limit is considered outlier. We will use python pandas to remove outliers on a sample dataset and in the end, as usual, I have an interesting exercise for you to practice

Others benefit from ""Gaussian-like"" distributions, as in such distributions the observations of X available to predict Y vary across a greater range of values. Thus, Gaussian distributed variables may boost the machine learning algorithm performance.

Previously, ML practitioners at Airbnb spent roughly 60% of their time on collecting and writing transformations for machine learning tasks. Zipline reduces this task from months to days - by making the process declarative. It allows data scientists to easily define features in a simple configuration language. The framework then provides access to point-in-time correct features - for both - offline model training and online inference. In this talk we will describe the architecture of our system and the algorithm that makes the problem of efficient point-in-time correct feature generation, tractable.

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server

1. What should a production ML feature engineering platform have and why?
2. When do I need one?
3. What are my options if I have to build one?

This talk draws upon the Scribble‚Äôs experience in building and evolving a production feature engineering platform, and the many conversations we have had with user data scientists. The talk will focus on the learnings, and not on the Scribble product itself, and expand on the talk from Fifth Elephant Mumbai in Jan 2019 on reducing costs.

Dr. Venkata Pingali is Co-Founder and CEO of Scribble Data, an ML Engineering company based in Bangalore and Denver. Scribble‚Äôs flagship enterprise product, Enrich, accelerates ML productionization in enterprises. Before starting Scribble Data, Dr. Pingali was VP of Analytics at a political data consulting firm. He has a BTech from IIT Mumbai and a PhD from USC in Computer Science.",1053,9,0,0,0

by Benedikt Schifferer (Nvidia), Chris Deotte (Nvidia) and Even Oldridge (Nvidia)

The selection of features and proper preparation of data for deep learning or machine learning models plays a significant role in the performance of recommender systems. To address this we propose a tutorial highlighting best practices and optimization techniques for feature engineering and preprocessing of recommender system datasets. The tutorial will explore feature engineering using pandas and Dask, and will also cover acceleration on the GPU using open source libraries like RAPIDS cuDF and NVTabular.",2632,87,1,0,3

Please note that this a recorded webinar. It was recorded during live presentation.

Building ML model is easy if you know your data well. According to a survey in Forbes, data scientists spend 80% of their time on data preparation. The features in your data are important to the predictive models you use and will influence the results you are going to achieve. Though Deep learning takes care of feature engineering process by itself, but many ML model still require to go through this Feature Engineering phase. In this session I will be presenting on various feature engineering techniques such as Imputation, Handling Outliers, Binning, Log Transform, One-Hot Encoding, Grouping Operations, Feature Split, Scaling, Handling Date. It will be a demo heavy session where we will explore different techniques of Feature engineering.

805,pr5LXi4U10c,Python Tutorial: Feature selection vs feature extraction,Feature Selection,2020-03-20T03:29:20Z,"Want to learn more? Take the full course at  https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/dimensionality-reduction-in-python at your own pace. More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding & quickly apply skills to your daily work.

--- 
Reducing the number of dimensions in your dataset has multiple benefits.

Your dataset will become simpler and thus easier to work with, require less disk space to store and computations will run faster. In addition, models are less likely to overfit on a dataset with fewer dimensions.

The simplest way to reduce dimensionality is to only select the features or columns that are important to you from a larger dataset. The hard part here is to decide on which features are important. If you're an expert on what the data is about, you may know this by heart.

You would, for example, know that a person's favorite color is irrelevant if you want to predict whether they'll default on a loan. 

And with the pandas dataframe .drop() method, you could remove that feature easily. Just make sure to pass the axis argument '1', to specify we're dropping a column instead of a row. 

If you're new to a dataset, you'll have to do some exploring before you can take a decision on which features can be dropped.

Seaborn's pairplot() is excellent to visually explore small to medium sized datasets. It provides a one by one comparison of each numeric feature in the dataset in the form of a scatterplot plus, diagonally, a view of the distribution of each feature. 

The example shown here, visualizes a sample of the US army body measurement dataset called ANSUR. And we've set the kind of plot to show on the diagonal to 'hist' for histogram.

We can spot that the weight in pounds is perfectly correlated to the weight in kilograms since all points fall on a diagonal line. Since both features hold the same information it makes perfect sense to drop one of them.

If there would have been a numeric feature without any variance in the dataset such as the constant that has been added here, it too would have been easy to spot visually.

Also note, that we used the categorical 'gender' feature to color the points. Since all points in this sample are for males, we could decide to drop that feature too.

When we apply feature selection, we completely remove a feature and the information it holds from the dataset, such as the yellow column in this example. We try to minimize the information loss by only removing features that are irrelevant or hold little unique information, but this is not always possible.

Compared to feature selection, feature extraction is a completely different approach but with the same goal of reducing dimensionality. Instead of selecting a subset of features from our initial dataset, we'll be calculating, or extracting, new features from the original ones. These new features have as little redundant information in them as possible and are therefore fewer in number. One downside is that the newly created features are often less intuitive to understand than the original ones.

The dimensionality of datasets with a lot of strong correlations between the different features in it, such as the one shown here, can be reduced a lot with feature extraction. Intuitively, this makes sense, if I were to tell you that a person has long feet, long hands, long arms and so on, I could probably just summarize that this person is tall.

In fact, we can reduce the number of dimensions in this ANSUR dataset sample from 4 to 2 with a technique called PCA or Principal Component Analysis and keep 96% of the variance in the data. We'll be looking into PCA in detail in chapter 4.

For now, it's your turn to visually explore some datasets.

He goes over the process of adding parameters to your model while avoiding overfitting. He also discusses general tools for evaluating the quality of different features, many contained in packages like scikit-learn, and covers methods of testing the various features in your algorithm.

We calculate Chi-square between each feature & the target & select the desired 
number of features with best Chi-square scores or the lowest p-values. 

The Chi-squared (œá2) test is used in statistics to test the independence of two events. More specifically in feature selection we use it to test whether the occurrence of a specific feature & the target are independent or not.

For each feature & target combination, a corresponding high œá2 chi-square score or a low p-value indicates that the target column is dependent on the feature column.

Welcome to the #DataScienceFridays Rohit Ghosh, a deep learning scientist and an Instructor at GreyAtom will take us through Feature Selection in machine learning through this introduction series. 

In machine learning and statistics, feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for four reasons:
simplification of models to make them easier to interpret by researchers/users, - 
shorter training times,
to avoid the curse of dimensionality,
enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting(formally, reduction of variance)

The central premise when using a feature selection technique is that the data contains some features that are either redundant or irrelevant, and can thus be removed without incurring much loss of information. Redundant and irrelevant are two distinct notions, since one relevant feature may be redundant in the presence of another relevant feature with which it is strongly correlated.

Feature selection techniques should be distinguished from feature extraction. Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features. Feature selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples




This is the 1st in 3 videos about Feature Selection in Machine Learning. 

In this video, we will explore the importance of feature selection.

Feature selection means selecting and retaining only the most important features in the model. Feature selection is different from feature extraction. In feature selection, we subset the features whereas in feature extraction, we create a new feature from the existing features.

Filter method is faster and useful when there are more number of features. Wrapper method gives better performance while the embedded method lies in between the other two methods.

Link to Feature Selection blogpost: https://www.datasciencesmachinelearning.com/2019/10/feature-selection-filter-method-wrapper.html

In this video, we will also understand how to perform Feature Selection using scikit-learn.

1) Dropping features which have low variance
A) Dropping features with zero variance
B) Dropping features with variance below the threshold variance
2) Univariate feature selection
3) Model based feature selection
4) Feature Selection using pipeline

Feature Engineering for machine learning
Both Feature engineering and feature extraction are similar: both refer to creating new features from the existing features. Feature engineering refers to creating a new feature when we could have used the raw feature as well whereas feature extraction is creating new features when we can't use raw data in the analysis such as converting image to RGB values.

Q. feature selection data mining or machine learning

In machine learning, data mining and statistics, feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction.

Reference: wikipedia


Q. what is difference between filter and wrapper methods for feature selection ?

The main differences between the filter and wrapper methods for feature selection are: Filter methods measure the relevance of features by their correlation with dependent variable while wrapper methods measure the usefulness of a subset of feature by actually training a model on it.

As important features can be useful for evaluating specific defects, a feature selection approach has been used. For further evaluating the importance of features, several feature selection techniques (filters and wrappers) have been implemented as ml PipelineStages for usage on dataframes for incorporation in a complete Spark ml Pipeline, including preprocessing and classification. The general steps for building custom Spark ml Estimators are presented. The API of the newly implemented feature selection techniques is demonstrated and results of a performance analysis are shown. Besides that, experiences gained and pitfalls that should be avoided are shared.

Lecture abstract:

Feature selection problems have been extensively studied in the setting of linear estimation (e.g. LASSO), but less emphasis has been placed on feature selection for non-linear functions. In this study, we propose a method for feature selection in neural network estimation problems. The new procedure is based on probabilistic relaxation of the L0 norm of features or the count of the number of selected features. Our L0-based regularization relies on a continuous relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution; such relaxation allows our model to learn the parameters of the approximate Bernoulli distributions via gradient descent. The proposed framework simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression or classification function while selecting a small subset of features. We provide an information-theoretic justification for incorporating Bernoulli distribution into feature selection. Furthermore, we evaluate our method using synthetic and real-life data to demonstrate that our approach outperforms other commonly used methods in both predictive performance and feature selection

840,G6Hts7nFOYk,AI-Assisted Feature Selection for Big Data Modeling,Feature Selection,2020-07-21T15:24:36Z,"The number of features going into models is growing at an exponential rate thanks to the power of Spark. So is the number of models each company is creating. The common approach is to throw as many features as you can into a model. Features that don‚Äôt improve the model can easily end up hurting it by increasing model complexity, reducing accuracy and making the model hard for users to understand. However, since it takes a lot of manual effort to find the noisy features and to remove them, most teams either don‚Äôt do it or do it sparingly. We have developed an AI assisted way to identify which features improve the accuracy of a model and by how much. In addition, we present a sorted list of features with an estimate of what accuracy (e.g., r2) improvement is expected by their inclusion.

There are some existing methods to handle the automated feature selection, almost all of which are computationally expensive and not translatable to big data applications. In this work, we introduce a fast feature selection algorithm that automatically drops the less relevant input features, while preserving and in some cases enhancing the model accuracy. The method starts by automated feature relevance ranking based on bootstrapped model training. This ranking determines the order of feature elimination which is much more efficient than randomized feature elimination. There are other simplifying assumptions during this feature selection, as well as our distributed implementation of the process that enable fast parallelized feature selection on medical big data.

In this video I perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data that we collected from glassdoor in part 2 and cleaned in part 3. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

EDA is where we really start understanding our data. It where we start analyzing trends and begin to find insights. 

First, I do some additional data cleaning. I clean up the job titles, and do some feature engineering. 

Next, I look at histograms and box plots of the continuous data fields. This is an important step because we want normal data if we plan to do a regression analysis. 

We then look at the categorical data. We want to see what companies, states, industries, and sectors these jobs are offered in. 

After that, we make some pivot tables to better understand how average salary is different across our categorical categories. 

Finally, we make a word cloud to visualize some of the most common words found in the descriptions. 

Please stay tuned for part 5 where we start building models to predict salary!

What is EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS? What does EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS mean? EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS meaning - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS definition - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS explanation.

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.

Tukey defined data analysis in 1961 as: ""rocedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.""

Tukey's championing of EDA encouraged the development of statistical computing packages, especially S at Bell Labs. The S programming language inspired the systems 'S'-PLUS and R. This family of statistical-computing environments featured vastly improved dynamic visualization capabilities, which allowed statisticians to identify outliers, trends and patterns in data that merited further study.

Tukey's EDA was related to two other developments in statistical theory: robust statistics and nonparametric statistics, both of which tried to reduce the sensitivity of statistical inferences to errors in formulating statistical models. Tukey promoted the use of five number summary of numerical data‚Äîthe two extremes (maximum and minimum), the median, and the quartiles‚Äîbecause these median and quartiles, being functions of the empirical distribution are defined for all distributions, unlike the mean and standard deviation; moreover, the quartiles and median are more robust to skewed or heavy-tailed distributions than traditional summaries (the mean and standard deviation). The packages S, S-PLUS, and R included routines using resampling statistics, such as Quenouille and Tukey's jackknife and Efron's bootstrap, which are nonparametric and robust (for many problems).

Exploratory data analysis, robust statistics, nonparametric statistics, and the development of statistical programming languages facilitated statisticians' work on scientific and engineering problems. Such problems included the fabrication of semiconductors and the understanding of communications networks, which concerned Bell Labs. These statistical developments, all championed by Tukey, were designed to complement the analytic theory of testing statistical hypotheses, particularly the Laplacian tradition's emphasis on exponential families.",19760,,,0,6
853,gvz-FbWXIGg,Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python: Hands-On Live Demo by Flipkart Data Scientist,Exploratory Data Analysis,2020-05-06T13:41:51Z,"In this session, master data analysis using Python from a live demo by a Flipkart ML Decision Scientist. He will help you understand Exploratory Data Analysis by taking a problem, exploring each variable in the problem along with their meaning and importance using Python. We will do univariate analysis by understanding the target / dependent variable that is ('SalePrice') and multivariate analysis in order to understand how the target/dependent variable and independent variables interact. We will further do basic cleaning of the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers, and transform the categorical variable. We will also have test assumptions to check if data is meeting the assumptions that are required by most multivariate techniques. We will be using the following data science libraries - NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and Scikit-Learn. Here is the dataset that we are using in this session: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/

This is Part 2 of my kaggle project from scratch series where I analyze the kaggle data science developer survey data. 

In this video I show you how I approach data cleaning, data manipulation, and some light Exploratory data analysis. This video is meant to focus more on my process than the actual coding or results. I also use plotly for this project which is a tool I was previously unfamiliar with. I show you how I learn by getting my hands dirty. 

Part 1: https://youtu.be/r-DR9HBaipU

From a technical perspective, I do the following:
- Outline my analysis 
- load in and briefly explore the data 
- Check for null values 
- Organize the data so that it can be easily used to create charts 
- Create some basic charts with plotly express and plotly go
- Organize the data so that it can be segmented by profession 
- Build one ""advanced visual"" showing you the 4 iterations that it took me to get there. 

Resources I used:
- https://plotly.com/python/histograms/
- https://plotly.com/python/heatmaps/
- https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59406167/plotly-how-to-filter-a-pandas-dataframe-using-a-dropdown-menu

872,zIcgCZl37tU,The importance of exploratory data analysis and data visualization in machine learning - PyCon 2018,Exploratory Data Analysis,2018-05-12T21:18:55Z,"Speaker: Opetunde Adepoju

All the data in the world is useless if you cannot understand it. EDA and data visualization are the most crucial yet overlooked stage in analytics process. This is because they give insights on the most relevant features in a particular data set required to build an accurate model. It is often said that the more the data, the better the model but sometimes, this can be counter-productive as more data can be a disadvantage. EDA helps avoid that.

EDA is useful for professionals while data visualization is useful for end-users. 

For end-users: 
A good sketch is better than a long speech. The value of a machine learning model is not known unless it is used to make data driven decisions. It is therefore necessary for data scientists to master the act of telling a story for their work to stay relevant. This is where data visualization is extremely useful.  
We must remember that the end-users of the results are not professionals like us but people who know little or nothing about data analysis. For effective communication of our analysis, there is need for a detailed yet simple data visualization because the work of a data scientist is not done if data-driven insights and decisions are not made.

For professionals:
How do you ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? How do you choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? How do you define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Most data scientists ask these questions.  EDA answers these questions explicitly.
Also, EDA helps in understanding the data. Understanding the data brings familiarity with the data, giving insights on the best models that fit the data set, the features in the dataset that will be useful for building an accurate machine learning model, making feature engineering an easy process.

In this talk, I will give a detailed explanation on what EDA and data visualization are and why they are very helpful in building accurate machine learning models for analytics as well as enhancing productivity and better understanding for clients. I will also discuss the risks of not mastering EDA and data visualization as a data scientist.

Second video of our first chapter for our Supervised Learning with scikit-learn course by Andreas Mueller & Hugo Bowne-Anderson. First chapter free: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn

At the end of day, the value of Data Scientists rests on their ability to describe the world and to make predictions. Machine Learning is the field of teaching machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data - will a given tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam or not? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. You'll do so using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.",3778,24,1,0,1

885,5rTb6AkKhds,Exploratory Data Analysis,Exploratory Data Analysis,2016-12-09T22:38:13Z,"Dr. Brian Caffo from Johns Hopkins presents a lecture on ""Exploratory Data Analysis.""

Lecture Abstract
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the backbone of data science and statistical analysis.  EDA is the process of summarizing characteristics of a data set using tools such as graphs and statistical models.  EDA is a principal method for creating new hypotheses or determining basic empirical support for evolving existing hypotheses.  
EDA often yields key insights, especially those provided by plots and graphs, where key insights often hit you right between the eyes. In addition, new technology, such as interactive graphics, is greatly enabling EDA. However, care must be taken in EDA to not over-interpret the degree of confirmatory force of conclusions and to avoid attaching strict inferential interpretations to results. 
This lecture covers the basics of EDA, summarizes some key tools and discusses its role in inference.

Exploratory Data Analysis is an integral part of data analysis. It is the first step for Statistical Modelling. In this video we demonstrate how to perform exploratory data analysis of Time Series Data using Python. We use a variety of Python libraries such Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodel, Matplotlib for this analysis. EDA is very useful before you build any Statistical or Machine Learning models. In particular, this analysis is useful during modelling of Time Series models such as ARIMA, LSTM etc. In this example, we take stock index price data (Nifty Index data) and return data for the demonstration purpose.

This is a full data science tutorial and/or walk through and produces a reusable process that can be used over and over again on varying data sets with minimal changes and/or modifications.
 
In this video we will:
1) learn how to load all the required packages (dplyr, ggplot and xlsx) and get data from an Excel file with the read.xlsx function.
2) deal with removing NAs from the data both for columns and rows.
3) Look at the mean, median, min and max.
4) use ggplot to create a simple and then a more advanced histogram or bar graph to look at the reason codes.
5) Use a line graph to look at trends over time. In this case we will look at trending over 2019 and the weeks available to us in the dataset.
6) then we will use a box plot visual to look at the data breakout over time by reason code to see if we can identify any patterns.
7) summarize our findings.

This video is part one of a two-part series.

Kaggle is a subsidiary of Google and an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. On Kaggle, you can find many published datasets, data science and machine learning tutorials but most importantly, Kaggle is best known for their competitions.

The Titanic survival prediction competition is a great beginner's competition that introduces beginners to not only the Kaggle platform but also the process behind an end-to-end machine learning project, from loading and reading datasets to building a fully functional predictive model.

The aim of this competition is to analyse how different passenger features such as age, gender and ticket class correlate with survival and subsequently train a machine learning model to classify unknown passenger data. This is an example of a binary classification problem in machine learning where passengers are classified as either survived or did not survive.

This video covers the exploratory data analysis (EDA) section of my notebook. EDA is the process of exploring our datasets as well as summarise the key characteristics and trends in our data such as data types, distributions and correlation between numerical variables. 

I managed to gather three important insights as a result of the EDA process:
1. Female passengers were more likely to survive than male passengers
2. First-class passengers were most likely to survive in comparison to second class as well as third-class passengers
3. Passengers of younger ages, especially children were more likely to survive than the other passengers on the Titanic

A lot of time has gone into preparing the solution notebook as well as this video. So, if you enjoyed it or found it helpful in your own learning, it would mean the world to mean if you could like the video and subscribe to my channel.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Happy learning!

In fact, they work together. R is a programming language for statistical calculation. And RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that helps you develop programs in R. ... You can use R without using RStudio, but you can't use RStudio without using R, so R comes first.Many of R's standard functions are written in R itself, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally intensive tasks, C, C++, and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C, C++, Java, .NET or Python code to manipulate R objects directly.

There are partitions containing files on our hard disk. Delete them. To do it, right-click on each of the partitions and select ‚ÄúDelete volume.‚Äù Create ‚ÄúNew Volume (D:)‚Äù in the free space that appeared after deleting the volumes. This way, we get a disk from where partitions containing files were deleted. 

Top Tools to Recover Data From an HFS+ Drive: https://hetmanrecovery.com/recovery_news/top-programs-for-data-recovery-on-a-disk-with-the-hfs-file-system.htm

Content:
0:00 - Intro;
0:45 - Recovering files of deleted partitions using R-Studio
2:16 ‚Äì Conclusion

In order to recover files from the deleted partitions with R-Studio:
‚Ä¢ Start the program and select the hard disk from which a partition should be recovered.
‚Ä¢ Click on the ‚ÄúScan‚Äù button.
‚Ä¢ Select additional settings in the window that opens and click on ‚ÄúScan.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Wait until the scanning process is complete. 
In the process of scanning, the program calculates its duration: note the status line at the bottom of the program window.
‚Ä¢ As a result, R-Studio showed the list of partitions found in the scanned hard disk. 
‚Ä¢ View the contents of the partition, the size of which corresponds to the previouly deleted volume. 
‚Ä¢ R-Studio showed the contents of this partition, where deleted files were not found. It has the same result for other recognized partitions.

‚Ä¢ After scanning the existing partition named ‚ÄúNew Volume‚Äù which we created instead of the four deleted partitions, the program did find the files from the deleted partitions.

‚Ä¢ Select the files and folders you need to recover and click the Recover icon in the upper menu of the program.
‚Ä¢ Specify the folder to save the recovered files and click ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ The files and folders have been recovered.

To sum up, we can say that the program did a good job. In terms of quality of data recovery, R-Studio is a direct competitor to Hetman Partition Recovery: it can recover files from deleted or formatted partitions, create disk images and recover data from there as well; it has a good preview function for files to be recovered.

The things to make Hetman Partition Recovery a better choice include a user-friendly interface, far higher speed of work (both when scanning media and recovering data) and ease of use; the latest update adds the function of data recovery from virtual drives and virtual machine drives. 
Hetman Partition Recovery offers you a two-step or three-step data recovery solution, which makes the process of recovery much simpler and improves the final result.

If you have more information to share, or any suggestions about file recovery from a deleted partition or hard disk, we‚Äôll be glad to see your comments.

The first 25 minutes is making dashboard changes (voila 02:12; dash 08:20; streamlit 16:10), followed by coding two interacting inputs (shiny app review 20:14; voila 25:25; dash 55:10; streamlit 01:07:10).

Hot takes and timestamps:

* voila (02:12; 25:25): good for simple interaction in notebooks.
* dash (08:20; 55:10): uses web framework flask, but cumbersome syntax.
* streamlit (16:10; 1:07:10): incredibly simple and powerful!

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. 
Python has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next ""Big Thing"" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

Based on a set of points (let‚Äôs think in a bidimensional space as exemplified in the figure), DBSCAN groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement (usually Euclidean distance) and a minimum number of points. It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions.

1011,Eb8XJkU-SVk,Most likely question for June 2021 - Rank Order Clustering Algorithm - New Portion in SCMPE,Clustering Algorithm,2021-03-31T12:30:16Z,"The above is the video of SCMPE - CA FINAL - PAPER 5 - RTP May 2021 issued by ICAI. Complete 5 hours and 15 minutes video - all regular students have got in their lifetime updates. 

This is a video of Q4 and Q5 of RTP, which is one of the new portion issued by ICAI. It pertains to Rank Cluster Algorithm Matrix. It is one of the applications of cellular manufacturing. Complete notes are there on our telegram channel t.me/CAFINAL_AJNEXT.

The above lectures do not have any formulas. It is taught from scratch and even if you do not know how to solve it, you will be able to solve it. 

any doubts can be addressed on our telegram channel: t.me/@ajnext

Steps
1. Production Flow Analysis rests on the basic idea to identify items that are made with the same processes / the same set of equipment. These parts are assembled into a part family and such the same equipment can be grouped (clustering) into a cell to minimize material handling requirements. There are various clustering methods
(i) Part family grouping - Form part families and then group machines into cells
(ii) Machine grouping - Form machine cells based upon similarities in part routing and then allocate parts to cells
(iii) Machine-part grouping - Form part families and machine cells simultaneously.(this is what we are interested in)
2. Various heuristic and exact methods have been developed for grouping/clustering, but the simplest one is binary ordering, also known as rank order clustering or King‚Äôs algorithm.
3. Solving Rank order clustering algorithm.
Count Number of ROWS (i) = 5
Count Number of COLUMNS (j) = 5
4. Give Binary Weights (BW) to each Column as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 starting from the last one. In this case only up to 16 as there are 5 columns
 Calculate Decimal Equivalent (DE) for each row using a total of BW where there is an allocation. Compute the total of BW for each row and based on DE, give ranks (the highest one being 1). Re-arrange the rows based on ranks and make the new matrix. If BE is the same, you can give any rank to any part/machine.
5. Now, Give Binary Weights (BW) to each Row as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32‚Ä¶ starting from the last one. In this case only up to 16 as there are 5 rows
 Calculate Decimal Equivalent (DE) for each column using a total of BW where there is an allocation. Compute total of BW for each column
 Give Ranks for each column based on DE and re-arrange the matrix based on ranks.
6. Keep on repeating till their matrix is arranged in RANK ORDER perfectly for rows and columns. 
7. Once done, find the final clusters (clusters are an independent group of machines and parts that have got no correlation with each other and which manufacture parts of a family of parts).
8. Sometimes there might be a cell that may lie in two clusters. Mention that in form of a note. (see the second question)",52281,216,7,0,18

This Unsupervised Learning Tutorial will introduce you to the nitty gritty of Machine Learning and How Unsupervised Algorithms Work.
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. This tutorial will cover each method along with the example for better understanding.

Unsupervised learning algorithms can perform more complex processing tasks than supervised learning systems. Additionally, subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI. That is the reason some experts prefer Unsupervised learning over supervised learning. This tutorial will you to understand the difference between them and at the end of the video, you would be able to apply it practically as well.

This tutorial comprises of the following topics:
00:00:00  Introduction
01:00:04  Principle Component Analysis(PCA)

In this lecture of machine learning we are going to see BIRCH algorithm for clustering with example. BIRCH algorithm (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an unsupervised data mining algorithm which is used to perform hierarchical clustering over particularly large data-sets.The advantage of using BIRCH algorithm is its ability to incrementally & dynamically cluster incoming, multi-dimensional metric data points in an attempt to produce the best quality clustering for a given set of resources (memory and time constraints). single scan of the database is needed by BIRCH algorithm in most of the cases.

Project 1: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - This shows that you can clearly tell a story with your data. It also shows that you can collect, clean, and perform feature engineering. I recommend scraping your data or collecting it from an open api.

Project 2: Classification problem - With these projects you are predicting a binary or categorical outcome. An example would be the titanic dataset where you predict if people would have survived the crash. 

Project 3: A regression problem - In these types of analyses, you try to predict a continuous outcome. An example would be predicting how many likes a youtube video would get ;).

Project 4: A clustering problem - With this we use algorithms to understand which data points are related to eachother. 

Project 5: An advanced topic (NLP, Computer Vision, Deep Neural Nets) - These projects allow you to specialize and show off your skills!

Hi everyone! Today we have Abhishek Periwal with us. Abhishek is a machine learning data scientist at Flipkart and today he will be talking about how he got started in data science, how his journey has been and any advice that he has for new people who are looking to start in data science. 
Can you run us through some of the problems, projects that you handled while at Flipkart?  

I majorly worked in landing industry, so one of the problems like it is traditional problem is which is each industry is working on is predicting whether the customer if we are giving a particular credit line or credit product to the customer, will he payback or will she payback or not. So that is like one of the problems which we are solving. So how it is different in Flipkart, the thing is, the data other NBFCs banks are having the credit history of the customer, so we are solving it with a different dimension. We are looking into the purchase history of the customer and we are solving according to his budget behavior, his or her activity on  Flipkart. 
So, it starts from feature engineering first, you have to create the features which could be relevant. Now it is about EV testing because you don‚Äôt know the past of the person, whether he is a good customer or not. So you have to choose an experimental segment, experiment on that, then you build a model which is biased then you create another model to remove the biases of the previous model. So things keep iterating and going in a better and better way. So this is one of the projects and projects which I am working on is still in the development phase. I hope we will have a good product by the end of this year.",12530,220,12,0,4

In almost every data science interview I have had, I have talked about at least one of these projects. 

Data science project 1: Basketball season win total prediction 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_SMU701qlA
Data science project 2:  RNN to predict the price of crypto currency
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfRhKHV8-t4
Data science project 3: UFC decision classifier
Data science project 4: Golfer cluster analysis 

As you can see, all of these data science projects were on subjects interesting to me. While not all of them were successful, I was able to articulate their pitfalls and was able to clearly explain the possible next steps. I was also extremely focused on the outcome and who would be using the research.

Data science projects payoff in multiple ways. First, they help you learn data science in an extremely efficient way. With projects you are able to narrow the gigantic scope of data science down to a single problem. 

Next, data science projects can pay off by helping you to land a job. You gain valuable, real world, experience by doing these. You also showcase some skills that are difficult to manifest through your more traditional work. In addition to experience, you also have a portfolio to showcase that can have employers reaching out to you rather than you chasing them down all the time. 

Finally, data science projects can pay off financially. Many projects can turn into products, content, or companies. My own youtube channel actually started off by a project that I did.

I have gotten quite a few requests to do data science project from scratch. I also left these series mostly unedited so you can see me get stuck and how I figure out the path forward. 

The next phases of the project are, data collection, data cleaning, eda, model building, and productionzation. 

For data science project ideation, you generally have two approaches. You can look through available data on kaggle or google data, or you can come up with an idea and then go out and find your data. In this video, I show you how to do both approaches.

I end up choosing a data science project based on a simple whiteboarding session. We will try to predict data science salaries based on data scraped from glassdoor or linkedin. 

In part 2 I will show you how to scrape your data and how to set up a github repo.

Detailed video description! (timeline can be found in comments)

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer‚Äôs buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

Many people I talk to struggle to come up with data science projects. To me, identifying problems and digging into them is one of the most important parts of becoming a data scientist to begin with. Finding interesting projects is a skill and is something you can improve on. 

Technique 1 - Focus on the problems that you face. Data science can be used to help solve these and make your life or the lives of people around you easier. I recommend writing 10 project ideas each day to get you used to coming up with them.

Technique 2 - Browse datasets and find one you like. There are tons of repositories of free data online, kaggle, google datasets, etc.. You can just browse these and pursue a dataset that piques your interest.

Technique 3 - Get feedback from and analyze your communities. Most online forums are filled with problems. Use data science to help solve them!

About the course 

Python has been one of the premier, flexible, and powerful open-source language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and has powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis. For over a decade, Python has been used in scientific computing and highly quantitative domains such as finance, oil and gas, physics, and signal processing. 

Edureka's Python Certification Training not only focuses on the fundamentals of Python, Statistics and Machine Learning but also helps one gain expertise in applied Data Science at scale using Python. The training is a step by step guide to Python and Data Science with extensive hands-on. The course is packed with several activity problems and assignments and scenarios that help you gain practical experience in addressing predictive modeling problems that would either require Machine Learning using Python. Starting from basics of Statistics such as mean, median and mode to exploring features such as Data Analysis, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Naive Bayes, Cross-Validation, Label Encoding, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines with a supporting example and exercise help you get into the weeds. 

Furthermore, you will be taught of Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to train your machine based on real-life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Edureka‚Äôs Python course will also cover both basic and advanced concepts of Python like writing Python scripts, sequence and file operations in Python. You will use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit, and master concepts like Python machine learning, scripts, and sequence.

Why learn Python?

So, how do we choose a project to work on? Where do we start? One way to approach it is to first look at some career websites and find a few jobs in data science that you aspire to have in the future. Write down the skills, qualifications, day-to-day expectations, and overall job description from the jobs that interest you. This will give you the project ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù that you can work with to formulate a project.

1084,Ao2_PNPWsys,Data Science Project on Covid-19 | Data Analysis using Python in Hindi (‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç) | Part 1,Data Science Projects,2020-08-17T13:29:48Z,"This is a corona Virus (covid19) tracker project using Python Programming. Here we processed the data using Pandas and requests,BeautifulSoup,Selenium libraries of Python . In this video series , you will learn .
-- How to do data Analysis with Python from scratch.
-- Steps involved in data Analysis.
-- how to collect data using web scrapping with Automation tool Selenium Driver function.
-- Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium for Data Professionals.


Q)) What is Web Scraping and  why we scraped Data using Selenium Tool instead of Beautiful Soup , request get method  or urllib.request library ?

=)) WEB SCRAPING : 
Web Scraping is a process to extract valuable information from websites and online contents. It is a free method to extract information and receive datasets for further analysis. In this era where information is practically highly related to each other, I believe that the need for Web Scraping to extract alternative data is enormous especially for me as a data professional.

=)) BEAUTIFUL SOUP
Beautiful Soup parses HTML into an easy machine readable tree format to extract DOM Elements quickly. It allows extraction of a certain paragraph and table elements with certain HTML ID/Class/XPATH.

 =)) SELENIUM
Selenium is a tool designed to automate Web Browser. It is commonly used by Quality Assurance (QA) engineers to automate their testings Selenium Browser application.
Additionally, it is very useful to web scrape because of these automation capabilities:
-) Clicking specific form buttons
-) Inputting information in text fields
-) Extracting the DOM elements for browser HTML code

Why Selenium :
==)The Limitations of Beautiful Soup
i) So far BS has been really successful to web scrape for us. But I discovered there are some limitations depending on the problems:
The requests takes the html response prematurely without waiting for async calls from Javascript to render the browser. This means it does not get the most recent DOM elements that is generated by Javascript async calls (AJAX, etc).
ii) Online retailers, such as Amazon or Flipkart put anti-bot software throughout the websites which might stop your crawler. These retailers will shut down any requests from Beautiful Soup as it knows that it does not come from legitimate browsers.

Steps Involved :
We will leverage on the following steps:
1) Pip install beautifulsoup4 and pip install requests. Requests would get the HTML element from URL, this will become the input for BS to parse.
2) Check which DOM element the table is referring to. Right click on your mouse and click on inspect element. Shortcut is CTRL+I (inspect) for Chrome Browser.
3) Click on the inspect button at the top left corner to highlight the elements you want to extract. Now you know that the element is a table element in the HTML document.
4) Initiate BS and extract state-wise data into PySoup variable.

 Are you looking to get a break in data science but struggling to clear interviews?  There‚Äôs a ton of variance in interview questions. You will get the IBM interview process which from what we have heard is really high level questions like, describe how a decision tree works? or Describe how this works or that works? #datascience #datascienceinterview #interviewpreparation

 You should think about the interview process as being similar to an important test at school: if you walk into interview without preparing, you are probably going to be in trouble. When answering any interview question you should have three goals in mind  Be clear, Be concise and Answer appropriately. Mastering the first, be clear, is mostly about preparation. You can only explain something clearly when you know what you‚Äôre talking about. Being concise is about carefully listening to and answering the question, but not more and Answering appropriately  just requires you keep in mind who you‚Äôre talking to. Are you speaking to a data scientist with 15 years of experience? and use as much jargon as you want.

1086,7O4dpR9QMIM,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Data Science Projects,2020-04-13T13:00:03Z,"This is part 5 of the Data Science Project from Scratch series. In this video I try a few different models to try to predict the glassdoor salary data that we collected in part 2, cleaned in part 3, and explored in part 4 of this series. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

When people think about data science, model building is what they usually think about. In this phase, we try multiple different data science algorithms to see which one performs the best. We tune each of these algorithms, and often try multiple at a time to see if we can produce a more accurate result. 

Here, I try a multiple linear regression, a lasso regression, and a random forest regressor. 

I chose to do a lasso regression because the data is fairly sparse, and we would expect a normalized model to perform better. I also selected a random forest because we had many dummy variables. With this type of data, we would also expect a tree based model to perform well. 

Please stay tuned for part 6 where we productionize this model.

See my video on how much statistics you really need for data science here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tEek2jPn-4

In this video, I talk about how much math you really need for data science, looking at two broad categories: calculus, and linear algebra.  My contention is, you don't need as much as you probably think you do.   Case in point, see the book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"" -- there is very little calculus in this book.

See this article for a discussion on distinction between practical and theoretical data science: https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/math-for-data-science/

I highly recommend this book for linear algebra purposes: https://amzn.to/3ihktwA

More important than the essential maths is the learning progress and how you are learning math. I am not a fan of a full coverage of math beforehand but I think you need to master at least the basics to have a better progress in general. In my opinion it is more efficient to learn math while you are learning the concept. 

The most important skills in my opinion are:
Statistics, Linear Algebra and Calculus

Looking forward to your comments and thoughts on that!

Data science problems are modelled and solved using mathematical algorithms. For example, to predict store revenues using advertisement expenditure, we could model this problem as:

                  Store Revenues = A + B*adExpenditure

where 'A' and 'B' are model parameters. These parameters could be estimated by a mathematical method called Ordinary Least Squares(OLS). OLS could be understood with 12th standard mathematical concepts.""

Great Learning brings you this live session on ‚ÄúRole of Mathematics in Data Science‚Äù. In this session, we will comprehensively learn about the need for maths in the field of data science. Once we understand the need for Maths, we will look at some important topics that everyone needs to know. We will start off by learning about the fundamentals of statistics such as measures of central tendency and measures of deviation. Going ahead, we will dive into the field of probability. We will understand the basics of probability and then we will learn about conditional probability and learn about this theorem called Bayes Theorem. Further, we will learn about normal distribution and understand why is it so important in the field of data science. All of these would form the pillars of data science in terms of mathematics. The best part of this session is, it is not only concept-based, but we will also be working on a lot of questions as well. Once the live session is done, there will also be a QnA, where you can ask all your queries.

Hi,
This is Aman, a data scientist by profession.

About this video:
Calculus Concepts For Data Science|Calculus for Machine Learning|Statistics for Data Science 
In this video, I explain basics of calculus concepts to be understood from data science point of view. I explain about constant slope vs changing slope in case of straight line vs curve. I explain concepts of derivative and integration with simple example as well so that it can be applied in the problem of data science and machine learning. This course offers a brief introduction to the multivariate calculus required to build many common machine learning techniques. I start at the very beginning with a refresher on the ‚Äúrise over run‚Äù formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster.
This video answers below question:
1. What is slope of a straight line
2.What is slope of a curve
3.What is significance of derivatives in machine learning
4.What is significance of integration in machine learning
5. How to use calculus for data science and machine learning

Hadoop and its associated distributions from Hortonworks, Cloudera and MapR include a dizzying array of technologies. We will start talking about the origins and history of Hadoop, and then take a look at how all the different open-source systems that surround Hadoop clusters fit together. After this video, you will have a high level overview of the biggest systems in the world of Hadoop today and see how they interoperate. 

Apache projects tend to have cryptic names, and we will decipher what they all really do. We will talk briefly about the core components of Hadoop: HDFS, YARN, and MapReduce. And then we will touch upon all the other systems  built up around them, including Apache Spark, Hive, Pig, Ambari, Oozie, Zookeeper, Sqoop, Flume, Kafka, Mesos, HBase, Storm, Hue, Presto, Zeppelin, MySQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, Drill, and Phoenix. 

My larger course covers each technology in more depth, but at the end of this video, these terms should at least make sense to you and you will be less confused when people talk about them all. 

Course Description
The world of Hadoop and ""Big Data"" can be intimidating - hundreds of different technologies with cryptic names form the Hadoop ecosystem. With this course, you'll not only understand what those systems are and how they fit together - but you'll go hands-on and learn how to use them to solve real business problems!

Learn and master the most popular big data technologies in this comprehensive course, taught by a former engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb. We'll go way beyond Hadoop itself, and dive into all sorts of distributed systems you may need to integrate with.

Install and work with a real Hadoop installation right on your desktop with Hortonworks and the Ambari UI
Manage big data on a cluster with HDFS and MapReduce
Write programs to analyze data on Hadoop with Pig and Spark
Store and query your data with Sqoop, Hive, MySQL, HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB, Drill, Phoenix, and Presto
Design real-world systems using the Hadoop ecosystem
Learn how your cluster is managed with YARN, Mesos, Zookeeper, Oozie, Zeppelin, and Hue
Handle streaming data in real time with Kafka, Flume, Spark Streaming, Flink, and Storm
Understanding Hadoop is a highly valuable skill for anyone working at companies with large amounts of data.

Almost every large company you might want to work at uses Hadoop in some way, including Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, IBM,  Spotify, Twitter, and Yahoo! And it's not just technology companies that need Hadoop; even the New York Times uses Hadoop for processing images.

This course is comprehensive, covering over 25 different technologies in over 14 hours of video lectures. It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises, so you get some real experience in using Hadoop - it's not just theory.

You'll find a range of activities in this course for people at every level. If you're a project manager who just wants to learn the buzzwords, there are web UI's for many of the activities in the course that require no programming knowledge. If you're comfortable with command lines, we'll show you how to work with them too. And if you're a programmer, I'll challenge you with writing real scripts on a Hadoop system using Scala, Pig Latin, and Python.

You'll walk away from this course with a real, deep understanding of Hadoop and its associated distributed systems, and you can apply Hadoop to real-world problems. Plus a valuable completion certificate is waiting for you at the end! 

Please note the focus on this course is on application development, not Hadoop administration. Although you will pick up some administration skills along the way.

I hope to see you in the course soon!

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

In this video you would learn, How Hadoop Works, the Architecture of Hadoop, Core Components of Hadoop, What is NameNode, DataNode, Secondary NameNode, JobTracker and TaskTracker.

In this session let us try to understand, how Hadoop works ?

The Hadoop framework comprises of the Hadoop Distributed File System and the MapReduce framework.

Let us try to understand, how the data is managed and processed by the Hadoop framework?

The Hadoop framework, divides the data into smaller chunks and stores each part of the data on a separate node within the cluster.

Let us say we have around 4 terabytes of data and a 4 node Hadoop cluster.

The HDFS would divide this data into 4 parts of 1 terabyte each.
By doing this, the time taken to store this data onto the disk is significantly reduced.

The total time taken to store this entire data onto the disk is equal to storing 1 part of the data, as it will store all the parts of the data simultaneously on different machines.

In order to provide high availability what Hadoop does is, it would replicate each part of the data onto other machines that are present within the cluster.

The number of copies it will replicate depends on the ""Replication Factor"".

By default the replication factor is set to 3.

If we consider, the default replication factor is set, then there will be 3 copies for each part of the data on 3 different machines.
In order to reduce the bandwidth and latency time, it would store 2 copies of the same part of the data, on the nodes that are present within the same rack, and the last copy would be stored on a node, that is present on a different rack.

Let's say Node 1 and Node 2 are on Rack 1 and Node 3 & Node 4 are on Rack 2.

Then the 1st 2 copies of part 1 will be stored, on Node 1 and Node 2, and the 3rd copy of part 1, will be stored, either on Node 3 or Node 4.

The similar process is followed, for storing remaining parts of the data.

Since this data is distributed across the cluster, the HDFS takes care of networking required by these nodes to communicate.
Another advantage of distributing this data across the cluster is that, while processing this data, it reduces lot of time, as this data can be processed simultaneously.

This was an overview of, how Hadoop works, we would learning, how data is written, or read from the Hadoop cluster, in the later sessions.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop, which is not less than a panacea for all those companies working with BIG DATA in a variety of applications and has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

1160,vRQWB87cvRA,hadoop in hindi | Introduction of hadoop | What is Hadoop,Hadoop,2017-08-17T03:36:54Z,"Hadoop is an open source, a Java-based programming framework that supports the processing and storage of extremely large data sets in a distributed computing environment.
¬†Hadoop is capable to work on the cluster(thousand of interconnected machines) and handle to thousand of terabytes data.
Hadoop provides rapid data transfer rate.
¬†Hadoop is capable to work on a cluster(thousand of interconnected machines) and handle to thousand of terabytes data.
It is developed by doug cutting and Mike cafarella in 2006.
It was inspired by Google's MapReduce programming framework.
1. HDFS( Hadoop Distributed file system)- HDFS Architecture: It has 2 Types of Nodes-
1. NameNode
2. Data Node
3. YARN(Yet another resource Negotiator)
NameNode is also known as the Master
NameNode only stores the metadata of HDFS .
NameNode does not store the actual data or the dataset. The data stored in the DataNodes physically.
NameNode knows the list of the blocks and its location for any given file in HDFS. With this information, NameNode knows how to construct the file from blocks.
NameNode is a single point of failure in Hadoop cluster.
NameNode is usually configured with a lot of memory (RAM). Because the block locations help in main memory.
DataNode is responsible for storing the actual data in HDFS.
DataNode is also known as the Slave
NameNode and DataNode are in constant communication.
When a DataNode is down, it does not affect the availability of data or the cluster. NameNode will arrange for replication for the blocks managed by the DataNode that is not available.
Apache Hadoop 2.0 includes YARN, which separates the resource management and processing components.¬†

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

Data Analyst does a lot of descriptive analytics. On the other hand, Data Scientist also does descriptive analytics. But also data scientists do something called
predictive analytics.

So let's try to understand what Descriptive and Predictive analytics mean.


Descriptive Analytics is all about analyzing the historical data to answer this particular question which is ""WHAT HAS HAPPENED TILL NOW??"".


Predictive Analytics also involves analysis of historical data but, predictive analytics is mainly all about answering the question 
which is.. ""WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE??""

Let's understand this with a simple example.
I have sales data of XYZ company in a table format.

As part of descriptive analytics, we can simply create a scatter chart so that we can quickly understand how the company has been performing
in terms of sales in the previous years.

Now let's look at predictive analytics. So now that we know how the company has been performing in the previous years, can we predict what's gonna 
happen to the sales in the coming years?.. Will the sales increase, or decrease or does it remain the same??.. 
If we are able to answer these questions, then it is called as predictive analytics.

So coming back to the comparison of Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles, 
Now that we have some idea about the differences between the two roles, lets now look at skills needed for each of these two roles.

Data Analysts should be good with Math and Statistics.
They should be good with handling the data.
 -- This includes knowledge of ETL (or Extract Transform and Load) operations on data and experience working with popular
 ETL tools such as Informatica ‚Äì PowerCenter,IBM ‚Äì Infosphere Information Server, alteryx,
 Microsoft ‚Äì SQL Server Integrated Services (SSIS), Talend Open Studio, SAS ‚Äì Data Integration Studio
 ,SAP ‚Äì BusinessObjects Data Integrator, QlikView Expressor or any other popular ETL tool.
 -- They should be comfortable in handling data from different sources and
 in different formats such as text, csv, tsv, excel, json, rdbms and others popular formats.
 -- They should have excellent knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language).

 Its a Bonus to have 
 -- The knowledge of Big data tools and technologies to handle large data sets.
 -- NoSQL databases such as HBase, Cassandra and MongoDB.
They should be expert in Analysing and Visualizing the data.
 -- They Should have experience working with popular data analysis and visualization packages in python and R 
    such as numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, ggplot and others.
 -- Experience with popular data analysis and visualization BI tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BI, SAS BI, Oracle BI, QlikView or any other 
 popular BI tool
They should have good communication and storytelling skills.


Lets now look at the skills needed for data scientist role.

Data scientist also does descriptive analytics just like data analysts. Apart from that, they also do predictive analytics.

So as part of Descriptive analytics:
Data Scientists should be excellent with Math and Statistics.
Data scientists should be good with handling data
 -- So yes, they should have experience working with popular ETL frameworks.
 -- They should have excellent knowledge of SQL.
 -- Many companies expect data scientists to have mandatory knowledge of big data tools and technologies to 
    work with large datasets and also to work with structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. 
 -- Its good to have the knowledge of NoSQL databases such as HBase, Cassandra and MongoDB.
They should be expert in Analysing and Visualizing the data.
 -- Experience working with popular data analysis and visualization packages in python and R.
 -- Experience with popular data analysis and visualization BI tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BI, SAS BI, Oracle BI, QlikView or any other 
 popular BI tool.
They should also have excellent communication and storytelling skills.

And as part of predictive analytics, 
They should be good in using the techniques in artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and statistical modeling to make
   future predictions using the historical data.
Exposure to popular predictive analytics tools such as SAP Predictive analytics, Minitab, SAS Predictive Analytics, Alteryx Analytics, IBM 
    predictive analytics or any other popular predictive analytics tool.
They should have very good exposure to popular machine learning and deep learning packages available for Python and R such as 
    scikit learn, tensorflow, theano,rpart, caret, randomForest, nnet, and other popular libraries.",405140,11182,270,0,180

1188,s2jidSwUh-0,Data Scientist: The soft skill you should develop to be good at Data Science.,Soft skills for data science,2021-03-01T11:55:52Z,"Some of the best data scientists I have worked with, have not been great because of their machine learning or statistics skills, but because of the soft skills they bring to their job, and one of them is their interpersonal skills.

Having the ability to understand and empthasise why the stakeholder wanted the piece of analysis, can really help data scientists be better at explaining their work and become trusted advisors to the business.

I've seen a trend where when hiring data scientists, my clients and I are placing more emphasis on interpersonal skills. The future data scientist, must have this skill, it will be something that will truely differentiate and make them stand out.

1191,EMO1nAIrRGg,Data Storytelling ‚ùå The ESSENTIAL Data Science Skill in 2021,Soft skills for data science,2020-12-14T12:00:07Z,"Data storytelling is a skill that requires good communication skills, a soft skill that you need in order to have an edge over other data scientists or engineers.
 
Apart from technical skills, soft skills like to be a good communicator will take you a long way. So imagine being a great data scientist as well as a good communicator. You'll be at the top of your game. 

Of course data storytelling cannot be a job title in itself. Or maybe it can be but beware of that. Companies tend to like to dilute a job in many small sub-titles so they artificially increase their headcount. 

So don't be a data storyteller as a job title, be a real data scientist with data storytelling skills. Because no matter how good of a communicator you are or will become you still need the technical skills to actually deliver and be of value to a company or a client.

So build yourself up as a data storyteller as well if you want to be successful as a data scientist in the years to come.

Data science is exactly what it sounds like: performing science with data. The soft skills which make for a great scientist thus transfer to a data scientist and any marketer who wants to adopt a perspective of using the scientific method to improve their marketing. It's so important to note that if your workplace lacks or actively opposes these qualities, your ability to grow will be seriously hindered.

Alexander has some of the most in-depth data science projects I've seen. These are great case studies for anyone looking to up their game.

Danny's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYPQz_qySbPESTK8k2ky5g
Alexander's Website: https://alexander-kahanek.github.io/

Portfolio:
- Very nice web layout
- Maybe keep it to one scrollable page
- Love the about me, perfect place to put it and cute dog
- Cool to see someone pursuing this career after going back to school
- Key thing is he is transitioning, not jumping
- No age for data science

Resume 
- I like the digital resume, but maybe a pdf or picture of a traditional one would make more sense here
- I don't love the *** scale. For me this is usually a box to check (Can he do this, we will find out his aptitude later) One thing I've found is that people have no clue how to judge their own ability
- More expansion on the types of skills
- Love how he talks about his projects and what he is doing
- Don't see a need for the soft skills section

Linkedin 
- More connections

Who‚Äôs the data engineer and what do they do?

Data engineers are the Jedi Knights of data science. They rely on a blend of analysis, wisdom, experience, and judgment to make key decisions for a company‚Äôs success. A data engineer is a self-starter who is inspired to complete more than your usual number of tasks.

Data engineers are the ones to take things further up the data science pipeline. They use the data architects‚Äô work as a steppingstone and then pre-processes the available data. These are the people who ensure the data is clean and organized and ready for the analysts to take over.

Data engineers also implement complex, large scale big data projects with a focus on collecting, managing, analyzing and visualizing large data sets. They are also the ones who turn raw data into insights using various tool sets, techniques, and cloud-based platforms.

That said, for a data engineer, knowledge of data modeling for both data warehousing and Big Data is a must, along with experience in the Big Data space (Hadoop Stack like M/R, HDFS, Pig, Hive, etc.). Of course, the ability to write, analyze, and debug SQL queries will helps the aspiring data engineer score high on any employer‚Äôs recruitment list.

In terms of soft skills, they are great team-players. A data engineer knows how to actively collaborate with data scientists and executives to build solutions and platforms that meet, or even exceed a company‚Äôs business needs...

Who is the data architect exactly?

If you‚Äôve seen the 1999 cult movie The Matrix, you probably recognize the Architect as the creator of the utopian world for human minds to inhabit. Much like their blockbuster counterpart, data architects create the database from scratch. They design the way data will be retrieved, processed, and consumed.

Data architects are technical experts who adapt dataflow management and data storage strategy to a wide range of businesses and solutions. They‚Äôre in charge of continually improving the way data is collected and stored. In addition, data architects control access to data. So, all you corporate spies out there ‚Äì now you know who to look for.

Data architects are also responsible for design patterns, data modeling, service-oriented integration, and business intelligence domains. They often partner with fellow data scientists and IT guys to reach the company‚Äôs data strategy goals.

A data architect constantly seeks out innovations to provide improved data quality and reporting, eliminate redundancies, and provide better data collection sources, methods, and tools...

Why should you take this Big Data and Data Science Course?

As an expert in this field, you will need to have a working knowledge of the three key pillars in the analytics ecosystem: data management, data science and reporting and visualization. This master‚Äôs program will hone your skills in:
 
Big Data:
Big data management is the ability to store and process voluminous amounts of unstructured data. Today with the overflow of online information, most companies are adopting big data practices to manage these huge volumes. Hadoop provides the distributed file system for storage, and MapReduce programming in Java is used for the processing. In the analytics lifecycle, it is critical to be able to store and query data to feed the necessary algorithms.
 
Data Science:
Data Science algorithms use data to create insights. Once you have an effective way to crunch data, you can use historical data for descriptive and predictive analytics. This is done using a programming language like R or Python, which utilize libraries for statistical analysis. Learning these languages are important to be able to design custom models for analytics, a key expectation for any data scientist. These skills range from basic probability to advanced machine learning.
 
Reporting and Visualization:
Once you have insights into data, it is important to make the insights available to the organization using visualization and reporting.
 
This program also includes a number of electives to ensure you get broad knowledge of the entire ecosystem and complementary skills in these fields. The two-year period ensures you have enough time to ramp up, develop skills and apply them in real world scenarios.

Python is loved by Data Scientists and it has even shaken the foundations of R which was considered to be the backbone of Data Analytics. Use of Python for Data Analysis is growing especially among the non statisticians, and python course and python tutorials are loved by new data science aspirants. So, in the game of R vs Python, the latter is on the winning course. 

Python Online Tutorials are much loved, but they have been seen to be of little value. To learn python programming, do not count on free python tutorials rather take a full fledged course where you are taught to use python for Data Science.

Python Pandas Documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

1274,e7MsoJsO0WY,python video series for beginners video 9: what are modules packages and libraries in python,Python Libraries,2020-06-17T02:45:00Z,"In this video we will discuss python modules package and libraries and state the difference between them : 

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module‚Äôs name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.
A package is basically a directory with Python files and a file with the name init.py. This means that every directory inside of the Python path, which contains a file named init.py, will be treated as a package by Python. It's possible to put several modules into a Package.
A Python library is a reusable chunk of code that you may want to include in your programs/ projects. Compared to languages like C++ or C, a Python libraries do not pertain to any specific context in Python. Here, a 'library' loosely describes a collection of core modules.

https://youtu.be/R5uLNhRaGD0


Python library is a collection of functions and methods that allows you to perform many actions without writing your code.
import in python is similar to # include header_file in C/C++. Python modules can get access to code from another module by importing the file/function using import. The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only way.

1299,x0yD5pEZ_-g,Top 5 Python Libraries for Network Automation,Python Libraries,2020-10-27T13:00:13Z,"Within the past few years, network automation has seen an explosion in popularity. As a result, there seems to be an ever-increasing supply of tools available to the modern engineer to help implement automated network configuration and change management. While having such a wide and diverse array of tooling available is undoubtedly of great benefit to the community, it can certainly feel a little bit overwhelming and even intimidating.

To help simplify this, CBT Nuggets trainer John McGovern (@IPvZero) has identified what he believes to be the top five free Python libraries for network automation. All of these libraries are sufficiently mature, well-tested, and have a strong support within the automation community.

Okay, now that we've covered a little bit of background on what machine learning is and some of the major types of machine learning problems, there's nothing like getting started with our own machine learning application in Python. And we're going to get started on that right now. So to do that, we're going to make use of several important Python libraries that will support our work. These include scikit-learn, SciPy, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.

We recommend installing all of these using the Anaconda Python distribution since it comes with all the libraries we'll need in this part of the course.

If you have some other existing Python installation, you can install the libraries we'll be using from the command line using pip, like this.

The most important library we'll be using for machine learning is called scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is the most widely used Python library for machine learning and it will be the basis for this course .............",1383,35,0,0,0

NumPy is a python library that is used for working with arrays. NumPy was developed by Travis Oliphant in 2005. It is an open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is helpful in solving problems related to linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

One of the most common Python data structures is lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. NumPy provides an array object which is known as ‚Äúndarray‚Äù and the fun fact is, it‚Äôs 50x faster than lists.

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++. To know more about this interesting library with amazing examples, watch this tutorial till the end.

1327,zD9yY-1wRUk,What is the difference between Numpy and Pandas in Python ? | Neeraj Sharma,Numpy,2020-03-09T02:17:16Z,"Diifference between Numpy and Pandas in Python

To understand the difference between two you need to understand what is numpy and what is pandas? And what is the purpose of them. Let‚Äôs understand one by one:
What is numpy?
Numpy means numerical python
It's the short form of numerical python

Why do we use it?
If you want to do any array based or matrix based computation, calculation and data analysis then it is better to use numpy

How it could be helpful?
you can do complex calculations very easily with the help of numpy, for example:
- If you want to multiply or add two or more arrays, you need not to run any loop, using numpy you can just multiply or add them like any other scalar entity:
c=a+b

Similarly you can perform any element wise operations easily without using any loop with the help of numpy.



What is Pandas?
Pandas stands for ‚ÄúPython Data Analysis"". It is most popular tool(python package) to do the data cleaning and analysis fast and easy.

Similarities in numpy and pandas
pandas adopted many coding styles from NumPy. Pandas also use the same style of working as the numpy uses it gives preference for data processing without loops

Difference between numpy and pandas:

#1
- Numpy works with arrays 
- While pandas works with data frames and series

#2
- NumPy is best suited for working with homogeneous i.e same kind of data
- While Pandas is best suited for working with tabular or heterogeneous i.e different kind of data

#3
You need to import numpy package to use numpy, like:
import numpy as np

You need to import pandas package to use pandas, like:
import pandas as pd

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers.

We can create numpy arrays in different ways in that one of the way is using arrays function.

Array Function:
Using this function we can create arrays from list or tuples or nested list or nested tuples.
Here you can see syntax example of array function in detail.

[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - PyCharm]
[Basel, CH]

By Christoph Deil

Do you have numerical code written in Python and Numpy? Do you wish it ran faster, using the full potential of your CPU?

Then you should try Numba, a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and Numpy code into fast machine code.

This talk will explain how Numba works, and when and how to use it for numerical algorithms, focusing on how to get very good performance on the CPU.

To understand this talk, only a basic knowledge of Python and Numpy is needed.

You will learn how Python compiles functions to bytecode and how Numba compiles bytecode to machine code. Why algorithms implemented using Numpy sometimes don't yield great performance, and how to do better using Numba. You will learn about the @numba.jit and @numba.vectorize decorators and how to create functions that use the CPU well by using e.g. multi-threading (several CPU cores), vector instructions (single instruction multiple data) and fast math (trade float accuracy for speed).

You will also learn when it does and doesn't make sense to use Numba, by contrasting it briefly with some other options for high-performance computing from Python: PyPy, C, C++, Cython, Numexpr, Dask, PyTorch, Tensorflow and Google JAX

Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. Matplotlib is written in Python and makes use of NumPy, the numerical mathematics extension of Python. In today‚Äôs video, we will be discussing Matplotlib using various examples.

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, PyQt, or GTK+.  It can be used in Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebook, and web application servers also.

Data Visualization makes our work so easy and makes such abundant data so simplified and easy to understand and work upon. Matplotlib does the same for us and it makes it easier to draw insights from abundant data and work accordingly on it. Want to know more about this interesting topic?

Yay finally posting again. Hopefully this video will help you get comfortable working through the matplotlib library. I'm going to post a follow up video with real-world examples (combining pandas with matplotlib) and different types of plots next week. I originally was going to include that in this one, but I thought the video was getting a bit too long.

In this video we walk through some of the basics of matplotlib. We start by making a simple line graph. We learn how to give the graph a title and label the x & y axis. We learn how to scale the graph by specifying the x & y tickmarks. After this, we restyle our line by passing in keyword arguments then do basically the same thing with a shorthand notation. We resize our graph and save it. Then we end with a simple bar chart.

It's used by many data scientists (myself included), and several other popular data visualization libraries like seaborn are built on top of Matplotlib.

In this tutorial, I'll show you the basic parts of a Matplotlib graph (this can be surprisingly confusing), I'll give you an easy formula for plotting, we'll go through some basic graphs, and then we'll dive into more details by looking at commonly asked questions.

(We'll also start off with how to create your data science coding environment using a conda virtual environment to install all of the necessary packages. Or, you can use Google Colab for free without setting anything up on your computer.)

Specifically, here's what we'll cover:

- How to understand the different parts of a Matplotlib graph: the figure, the axes, the axis, etc.
- How to plot basic graphs in Matplotlib: line plots, bar graphs, scatterplots, histograms, etc.
- How to plot multiple graphs in the same chart (like a line plot and a bar graph together).
- How to plot using different colors for different data.
- How to add and alter text like titles and axis labels.
- How to use subplots to show different graphs on different axes.
- How to tweak and alter the graph in many of the commonly needed ways.

You learn best through doing‚Äîso grab your computer, and get ready to learn some data visualization in Matplotlib!

Happy learning!

Matplotlib scatterplot. Matplot has a built-in function to create scatterplots called scatter(). A scatter plot is a type of plot that shows the data as a collection of points. The position of a point depends on its two-dimensional value, where each value is a position on either the horizontal or vertical dimension.

matplotlib is the de facto standard for data visualization with Python. While there are many other graphics libraries available almost everyone of them is a wrapper around the matplotlib library.  Visualization with matplotlib can be tedious and daunting if you don't know the basics.  This video covers a number of basic settings and capabilities through examples of scatter plots, one of the fundamental data analysis tools for discovering relationships between variables. Almost all of the techniques shown can be used in any visualization you make.",13897,185,1,0,21

I is commonly used with OpenCv images. pylab is a module in matplotlib that gets installed alongside matplotlib; and matplotlib.pyplot is a module in matplotlib. matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats.

Gist of code I used in this video (How to Display a Matplotlib RGB Image ) - http://www.codebind.com/python/opencv-python-tutorial-beginners-matplotlib-opencv/

OpenCV is an image processing library created by Intel and later supported by Willow Garage and now maintained by Itseez. opencv is available on Mac, Windows, Linux. Works in C, C++, and Python.
it is Open Source and free. opencv is easy to use and install.

Starting with an overview of what the course will be covering, we move on to discussing morphological operations and practically learn how they work on images. We will then learn contrast enhancement using equalization and contrast limiting.  Finally we will learn 3 methods to subtract the background from the video and implement them using OpenCV.

At the end of this course, you will have a firm grasp of Computer Vision techniques using OpenCV libraries. This course will be your gateway to the world of data science.  

Feel the real power of Python and programming! The course offers you a unique approach of learning how to code by solving real world problems.

This video provides complete coverage of Seaborn with many real world examples. Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn is often used because it makes attractive visualizations and works easily with Pandas and NumPy.

While with Matplotlib you often have to write multiple lines of code to create a plot, Seaborn makes assumptions on what you want which often translates into getting the same plot with 1 line of code.

If you want a video that condenses the whole Seaborn API and all that it can do into 1 video with a ton of examples, then this video is for you.

I cover most everything you'll learn by reading the API here. Next I'll cover¬†SciPy, StatsModels, Plotly, Cufflinks, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scrapy, Linear Algebra, Calculus and more. CLICK THE NOTIFICATION BELL

---

Hello! Welcome to this introductory course on Seaborn! My name is Erin Case, and I'll be your instructor.

So what is Seaborn? Seaborn is a powerful Python library for creating data visualizations.

It was developed in order to make it easy to create the most common types of plots.

The plot shown here can be created with just a few lines of Seaborn code.

This is a picture of a typical data analysis workflow. Data visualization is often a huge component of both the data exploration phase and the communication of results, so Seaborn will be very useful there.

There are several tools that can be used for data visualization, but Seaborn offers several advantages.

First, Seaborn's main purpose is to make data visualization easy. It was built to automatically handle a lot of complexity behind the scenes.

Second, Seaborn works extremely well with pandas data structures. Pandas is a Python library that is widely used for data analysis.

Finally, it's built on top of Matplotlib, which is another Python visualization library. Matplotlib is extremely flexible. Seaborn allows you to take advantage of this flexibility when you need it, while avoiding the complexity that Matplotlib's flexibility can introduce.

To get started, we'll need to import the Seaborn library. The line ""import seaborn as sns"" will import Seaborn as the conventionally used alias ""sns"". 

Why ""sns""? The Seaborn library was apparently named after a character named Samuel Norman Seaborn from the television show ""The West Wing"" - thus, the standard alias is the character's initials (""sns"").

We also need to import Matplotlib, which is the library that Seaborn is built on top of. We do this by typing ""import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"". ""plt"" is the alias that most people use to refer to Matplotlib, so we'll use that here as well.

Let's now dive into an example to illustrate how easily you can create visualizations using Seaborn.

Here, we have data for 10 people consisting of lists of their heights in inches and their weights in pounds. Do taller people tend to weigh more? You can visualize this using a type of plot known as a scatter plot, which you'll learn more about later in the course.

Use ""sns dot scatterplot()"" to call the scatterplot function from the Seaborn library. Then, specify what to put on the x-axis and y-axis.

Finally, call the ""plt dot show()"" function from Matplotlib to show the scatterplot. This plot shows us that taller people tend to have a higher weight.

How many of our observations of heights and weights came from males vs. females? You can use another type of plot - the count plot - to investigate this. Count plots take in a categorical list and return bars that represent the number of list entries per category. 

Use the ""countplot()"" function and provide the list of every person's gender.
This count plot shows that out of the 10 observations we had in our height and weight scatter plot, 6 were male and 4 were female.

Now, those were a couple of simple examples. Throughout this course, you'll learn to make more complex visualizations such as those pictured here. More importantly, you'll learn when to use each type of visualization in order to most effectively extract and communicate insights using data.

I‚Äôm excited to dive into Seaborn with you throughout this course. For now, let's practice what you've just learned!

We walk through the row and col options, and I then show you how to use the Seaborn FacetGrid map and map_dataframe methods to add plots to the FacetGrid. I demonstrate how to make a seaborn FacetGrid histogram as well as scatter plots.  I then teach you how to style the facet grid using methods and attributes including updating the Seaborn FacetGrid title through title templates and adding axes labels.  I also show you how to use sharey and ylim within the facet grid.  We next talk about displaying additional categorical data through the Seaborn FacetGrid hue, and I also show you how to add a hue legend.  I show you code for updating the palette and how to style a Seaborn FacetGrid KDEplot.  Finally, I demo a custom Python function that you can use to customize the facet grid however you like!

(19/30),Seaborn,2019-10-15T14:00:12Z,"Ce tutoriel Python fran√ßais vous pr√©sente Seaborn, la meilleure librairie pour la visualisation de donn√©es (Data Visualisation). Seborn permet de cr√©er des graphiques plus beaux et plus travaill√©s que maplotlib, en √©crivant seulement une ligne de code !
Seaborn est parfait pour la visualisation de Dataset Pandas, et permet de faire une bonne exploration statistique des diff√©rentes variables de vos donn√©es.

Pour commencer, la fonction pairplot de searborn est id√©ale pour avoir un bon aper√ßu de votre dataset. Pairplot permet de voir la relation entre chaque variable, et produit √©galement des histogrammes, parfait pour voir comment sont r√©parties vos donn√©es selon les diff√©rentes variables.

Seaborn permet √©galement de visualiser les donn√©es qui forment des cat√©gories gr√¢ce aux boxplot de seaborn. Les boxplots sont id√©ales et tr√®s puissantes, nous les voyons dans ce tutoriel √† la minute 09:20

Seaborn est tres facile a prendre en main, il y a peu de fonctions, et elles suivent presque toutes la m√™me structure: (x, y, data, hue)

catplot(x, y, data, hue)
boxplot(x, y, data, hue)
scatterplot(x, y, data, hue)
etc...

Je recommande √©galement d'explorer les fonctions Seaborn distplot() jointplot() et heatmap() qui sont tr√®s utilis√©es dans la pratique en Data Science et en Data Mining.

Amusez-vous bien avec Seaborn, et retenez les fonctions les plus utiles, comme pairplot !

First we talk about what the clustermap is: a matrix plot with a heatmap and two clustering dendrograms.  Next I walk you through some basic clustermap code for a toy data set so that you can understand what the clustermap does.  I then explain the algorithm behind the clustermap: hierarchical agglomerative clustering.  We discuss how the clustermap algorithm works and how it makes a dendrogram.  Then I show you how to build a clustermap for more advanced data and how you can use the seaborn clustermap standard_scale to scale your columns.  Then we move on to two important parameters: the distance metric and the linkage.  I walk you through what each of these are with example visuals, and we also see these in the seaborn clustermap code as the metric and method keyword arguments. Finally, I show you how to use the seaborn clustermap row_colors option to tag your rows by color based on a categorical column of your dataset.

More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding & quickly apply skills to your daily work.

--- 
Now that we have taken a look at distribution plots in Seaborn, we will transition to another basic visualization process by plotting linear regression lines. The previous analysis we performed is often referred to as univariate analysis because we only look at one variable. Regression analysis is bivariate because we are looking for relationships between two variables.

The regplot() function is the basis for building regression plots in Seaborn. The basic function call is similar to distplot(), but we explicitly define the x and y variables as well as the source of the data. Since we are using a pandas DataFrame, the x and y variables refer to the columns in the DataFrame. This basic process is similar for many other Seaborn plots so it is good to make sure you understand this well before moving on to more complex plots. 

In this specific plot, we are interested in any relationship between the alcohol content of the wine and the pH levels. The regression line hints that there might be a slight increase in pH values as the alcohol content increases.

One of the confusing points about Seaborn is that it may seem like there is more than one way to do the same plot. In the previous exercises, we looked at distplots and briefly discussed kde plots as a building block for the more robust distplot(). In a similar manner, the lower level regplot() and higher level lmplot() are related. They are called the same way and produce similar output. However, the lmplot() is much more powerful. In this example, we can look at the relationship between alcohol content and quality using both of these plot types. The output looks similar except for the aspect ratio. In the next slide, I will show how the lmplot() is much more flexible.

The use of hue and columns is a powerful concept that is present throughout many of Seaborn's functions. The use of plotting multiple graphs while changing a single variable is often called faceting. In this case, faceting can be accomplished by using the lmplot() function. The base function is very similar to regplot() but it provides much more power by allowing you to add additional information using columns, colors, or rows. There are an entire class of functions in Seaborn that support this type of faceting and we will continue to explore them throughout the course.

It is time to put these concepts into practice. In the following exercises, we will go through some more examples of using the regplot() and lmplot() functions to analyze a dataset. By the end of the exercises, you should have a good understanding of how Seaborn works and be prepared for learning about additional plot types supported by Seaborn.

This tutorial takes you through the basics and various functions of Seaborn. It is specifically useful for people working on data analysis. After completing this tutorial, you will find yourself at a position where you would be able to implement this knowledge towards a constructive purpose.

This ""Seaborn Python Tutorial"" will help you to implement all the different plots with Seaborn. Data Visualization is an essential component of a data scientist‚Äôs skill set and seaborn is one of the most popular packages in python to implement data visualization. With the help of seaborn, you can create beautiful bar-plots, box-plots, scatter-plots, histograms and so much more.

When you‚Äôre using Python for data science, you‚Äôll most probably have already used Matplotlib, a 2D plotting library that allows you to create publication-quality figures. There is another complementary package that is based on this data visualization library which is ""Seaborn"", which provides a high-level interface to draw statistical graphics, and this tutorial includes all the basic concepts of Seaborn Python that will help you to understand it in a better way.

This Tutorial comprises of the following topics:

We start this Seaborn linear model plot video by reviewing the basics of creating an lmplot and how you can use Seaborn lmplot hue and markers to depict categorical variables.  I then walk you through how to use the Seaborn lmplot FacetGrid options such as col and row.  These options allow you to create small multiples with straightforward code.  We then talk about a few extra options with the lmplot including x_bins to bin up your independent variables and logistic, which builds a logistic regression model instead of a linear regression model.  Finally, we see several examples of how you can style your lmplot through the scatter_kws, line_kws, and through the FacetGrid options.

A time series is a sequence of data being recorded at specific time intervals. The past values are analyzed to forecast a future which is time-dependent. Compared to other forecast algorithms, with time series we deal with a single variable which is dependent on time. So, lets deep dive into this video and understand what is time series and how to implement time series using R. 

Below topics are explained in this "" Time Series in R Tutorial "" -

1. Why time series?
2. What is time series?
3. Components of a time series
4. When not to use time series?
5. Why does a time series have to be stationary?
6. How to make a time series stationary?

Meanwhile, one important data type which includes time series, digital signals and any sequential observations is still mainly processed with rather standard mathematical and algorithmic routines. In this talk, we will review, what are the main sources of time series in the world, what are the ""basic"" algorithms and how exactly they might be improved and replaced with different neural network architectures. Apart of the models‚Äô details, we will also study the typical tasks that have to be solved while working with time series: classification, prediction, anomaly detection, simulation and others and exactly deep learning can be leveraged to solve them on the state-of-the-art level. Some previous experience with time series/signal processing is useful, but not required.

A key challenge with the growing volume of measured data in the energy sector is the preparation of the data for analysis. This challenge comes from data being stored in multiple locations, in multiple formats, and with multiple sampling rates. This presentation considers the collection of time-series data sets from multiple sources including Excel files, SQL databases, and data historians. Techniques for preprocessing the data sets are shown, including synchronizing the data sets to a common time reference, assessing data quality, and dealing with bad data. We then show how subsets of the data can be extracted to simplify further analysis.

About the Presenter: Abhaya is an Application Engineer at MathWorks Australia where he applies methods from the fields of mathematical and physical modelling, optimisation, signal processing, statistics and data analysis across a range of industries.

Time series has become one of the most important aspect for data representation and analysis. It is a series of data points in time order which is taken at successive equally spaced points in time. In this tutorial we'll be exploring the concept and application of Time Series in Stock Market. 

Forecasting methods like exponential smoothing, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) etc. will be discussed in this video so as to give you a good idea about various time series forecasting methods.

A time series is a sequence of observations over a certain period. A univariate time series consists of the values taken by a single variable at periodic time instances over a period, and a multivariate time series consists of the values taken by multiple variables at the same periodic time instances over a period. The analysis of temporal data is capable of giving us useful insights on how a variable changes over time, or how it depends on the change in the values of other variables (s). This relationship of a variable on its previous values and/or other variables can be analyzed for time series forecasting and has numerous applications.

Following pointers will be covered in this video:
00:00:00 Introduction 
00:01:26 Indices 
00:14:36 Simple Exponential Smoothing 
00:43:06 ARIMA Approach 
01:13:49 Comparing Models

By Andrew Gould

Download files here https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/videos/excelvba/scraping-web-pages.htm

https://www.wiseowl.co.uk - Scraping a web page in VBA involves getting a reference to an HTML document and then processing its elements to extract the useful parts and write them to another location in a readable format.  This video shows you how to do that using both Internet Explorer and basic XML HTTP requests.  You'll learn a bit about the Document Object Model, as well as how to identify HTML elements by name and by tag type.  You'll also see how to loop through various collections of HTML elements and their children using an example involving exchange rate tables.

1519,NwtxrbqE2Gc,Automated Web Scraping in R using rvest,Web Scrapping,2019-02-15T00:38:18Z,"How to automatically web scrape periodically so you can analyze timely/frequently updated data.

There are many blogs and tutorials that teach you how to scrape data from a bunch of web pages once and then you‚Äôre done. But one-off web scraping is not useful for many applications that require sentiment analysis on recent or timely content, or capturing changing events and commentary, or analyzing trends in real time. As fun as it is to do an academic exercise of web scraping for one-off analysis on historical data, it is not useful when wanting to use timely or frequently updated data.

Scenario: You would like to tap into news sources to analyze the political events that are changing by the hour and people‚Äôs comments on these events. These events could be analyzed to summarize the key discussions and debates in the comments, rate the overall sentiment of the comments, find the key themes in the headlines, see how events and commentary change over time, and more. You need a collection of recent political events or news scraped every hour so that you can analyze these events.

What we‚Äôll do:
We‚Äôll go through the process of writing standard web scraping commands in R, filtering timely data, analyzing or summarizing key information in the text, and sending an email alert of the results of your analysis. We‚Äôll set up our script to run every hour so that text is scraped and analyzed periodically to capture changing events and commentary, or analyze trends in real time. Feel free to bring your laptop and follow along!

Let‚Äôs go fetch your data!

Hey Guys, and welcome to another Fun and Easy Machine Learning Algorithm on Random Forests.

Random forest algorithm is a one of the most popular and most powerful supervised Machine Learning algorithm in Machine Learning that is capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. As the name suggest, this algorithm creates the forest with a number of decision trees.
In general, the more trees in the forest the more robust the prediction. In the same way in the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest gives the high accuracy results.


To model multiple decision trees to create the forest you are not going to use the same method of constructing the decision with information gain or gini index approach, amongst other algorithms. If you are not aware of the concepts of decision tree classifier, Please check out my lecture here on Decision Tree CART for Machine learning. You will need to know how the decision tree classifier works before you can learn the working nature of the random forest algorithm.

In general, the more trees in the forest the more robust the prediction. In the same way in the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest gives the high accuracy results.


To model multiple decision trees to create the forest you are not going to use the same method of constructing the decision with information gain or gini index approach, amongst other algorithms. If you are not aware of the concepts of decision tree classifier, Please check out my videos here on Decision Tree CART for Machine learning. You will need to know how the decision tree classifier works before you can learn the working nature of the random forest algorithm.

In this video I talk about the Random Forest algorithm.  These are one of my favorite machine learning algorithms and one of the most popular ones overall, and they have implications whether your goals are inference or prediction.

The base learner of the Random Forest is the Decision Tree.   These are simple and straightforward, but the problem is they tend to be high variance -- i.e. they overfit and do not generalize well from a training set to a test set.  Random Forests correct for this problem.   They are an ""ensemble learning method"" -- the process for creating them is as follows:

1) Create a bootstrapped dataset with a subset of available variables
2) Fit a Decision Tree using that data
3) Repeat the process
4) Tally ""votes"" for predictions across trees -- predicted class is the one with the most ""votes""

A key feature of Random Forests is that they can be used to produce Variable Importance plots.  These rank, from top to bottom, the most ""important"" variables in the data.   What is nice about these is, while RFs are not interpretable the way that regression models are, is they are constructed in a different way and can detect things like non-linear relationships.   See the diagram where RM is the most important variable, followed by LSTAT, followed by DIS.

Some other benefits of Random Forests are:
1) They are not extremely sensitive to outliers
2) They are fairly stable and can handle new data without changing dramatically
3) They have methods for handling missing data
4) They can be used for unsupervised learning (clustering)

However, some drawbacks are:
1) They can be slow and memory-intensive
2) Variable importance can become biased if you have: a) a mix of continuous and categorical variables, where the categorical variables have few levels; or b) correlated continuous variables

Last time we talked about how to create, use and evaluate random forests. Now it's time to see how they can deal with missing data and how they can be used to cluster samples, even when the data comes from all kinds of crazy sources.

NOTE: At 10:22 I overlooked one step. In this case, you plug in the most common value/median value for all observations in the training dataset that have that same category as the new copy that you created. For example, we created two new copies of the observation: one with with heart disease and one without heart disease. Now, for the new copy with heart disease, we plug in the most common value from the observations in the training dataset that have heart disease. For the new copy without heart disease, we plug in the most common value from the observations in the training dataset that do not have heart disease. We can then use the iterative method to refine the guess if we want, or we can just run those two copies down the tree and use the classification from the copy that got the most correct votes.

‚Ä¢ To learn how to classify data with tree models.
‚Ä¢ To learn how to assess model performance with cross-validation.

Data: 
‚Ä¢ Download the house price label excel file from https://github.com/xbwei/machine_learning_in_rapidminer/blob/master/house_price_label.xlsx

Steps:
1. Load the house_price_label data into RapidMiner.
2. Build a set of tree models to classify house types based on house ages and prices. Use Cross-Validation to assess the performance (including accuracy and kappa) of each model:
2.1. A decision tree model with a maximal depth of 5
2.2. A decision tree model with a maximal depth of 10 
2.3. A random forest model with 100 trees and maximal depth of 10 
2.4. A Gradient Boosted trees model with 20 trees and maximal depth of 5 
3. Bring more features, such as area, number of bathrooms and bedrooms, and lot size, to the tree models to classify the house type. See how the models‚Äô performance will change.

Therefore, it only makes sense to compare both approaches for the task of image segmentation. Random Forest based image segmentation has been covered in a previous tutorial. This tutorial goes through the process of switching the classifier from Random Forest to SVM in Python and then comparing results between both classifiers.  Spoiler alert - Random Forest is much faster and more accurate than SVM for image segmentation purposes.",3786,89,0,0,15

In this video I go through how to clean up your data to make it usable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Data cleaning is an extremely important and often overlooked step in the data science lifecycle. Python has some handy functions that allow you to parse and replace data relatively easily. You can also use regular expressions to do this; however, those are a bit beyond the scope of this video. I mostly use lambda functions because I think that this is the simplest approach.

The first thing that we clean is the data science salary. We need to make sure that it is numeric because we are using that as our dependent variable. We also want to go through and do some light feature engineering. We can get some info about the state of the job postings and the nature of the job postings themselves.

I went through and looked to see if the postings had python, r-studio, spark, aws, or excel listed and added those as features. 

Again, this is an iterative approach that is rather messy. Please stay tuned for part 4 of the series EDA!

1607,e0TfIbZXPeA,10 Super Neat Ways to Clean Data in Excel,Data Cleaning,2014-08-24T16:02:21Z,"In this video, I will show you 10 simple ways to clean data in Excel.

Data forms the backbone of any analysis that you do in Excel. And when it comes to data, there are tons of things that can go wrong ‚Äì be it the structure, placement, formatting, extra spaces, and so on.

Excel can be an amazing tool for data analysis. But we hardly get the data that can be used right away. And bad data leads to bad analysis.

Cleaning the raw data that you get in Excel will depend on what type and structure of data you get. There are a lot of things you can do before-hand to make sure your raw data get cleaned and ready for use.

Excel has a lot of formulas and functionalities that can help you clean your data. For example, you can use a formula such as TRIM to clean your data of leading, trailing, and double spaces. Or you can use the remove duplicate functionality to remove any occurrence of duplicate records.

The following data cleaning techniques are covered in this video:
 0:00 Get Rid of Extra Spaces (leading, trailing, and extra spaces between words)
1:20 Select and remove All Blank Cells/rows
2:38 Convert Numbers Stored as Text into Numbers
5:00 Remove Duplicates cells/records
7:21 Highlight cells that contain Errors
9:24 Change Text to Lower/Upper/Proper Case to make it all consistent
10:54 Parse Data Using Text to Column 
13:15 Spell Check (using a keyboard shortcut)
13:54 Delete all Formatting
14:33 Use Find and Replace to Clean Data in Excel

The data cleansing techniques covered in this video are some of the most common ones that you can use as soon as you get your raw data. Again, based on your dataset, you may need to add more to it.

Importing data from ERP systems like SAP or Oracle into Excel can be a pain. The data is usually very messy. You need to clean and organize the data to be able to use it in Excel reports. In this tutorial I'll show you 2 practical examples on how you can use Excel Power Query or Get and Transform in Excel to do the work for you. We also create an Excel Pivot Table to analyze the imported data. The great thing with Power Query is that the import is automatic. It's like a macro. Every time we get a new SAP data extract, we just have to refresh our Excel table and all the steps to organize the data will be automatically applied.

Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data. Data cleansing may be performed interactively with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing through scripting.

After cleansing, a data set should be consistent with other similar data sets in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry errors, by corruption in transmission or storage, or by different data dictionary definitions of similar entities in different stores. Data cleansing differs from data validation in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at the time of entry, rather than on batches of data.

The actual process of data cleansing may involve removing typographical errors or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. The validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid postal code) or fuzzy (such as correcting records that partially match existing, known records). Some data cleansing solutions will clean data by cross checking with a validated data set. A common data cleansing practice is data enhancement, where data is made more complete by adding related information. For example, appending addresses with any phone numbers related to that address. Data cleansing may also involve activities like, harmonization of data, and standardization of data. For example, harmonization of short codes (st, rd, etc.) to actual words (street, road, etcetera). Standardization of data is a means of changing a reference data set to a new standard, ex, use of standard codes.

Administratively, incorrect or inconsistent data can lead to false conclusions and misdirected investments on both public and private scales. For instance, the government may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on infrastructure and services. In this case, it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions. In the business world, incorrect data can be costly. Many companies use customer information databases that record data like contact information, addresses, and preferences. For instance, if the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers. The profession of forensic accounting and fraud investigating uses data cleansing in preparing its data and is typically done before data is sent to a data warehouse for further investigation. There are packages available so you can cleanse/wash address data while you enter it into your system. This is normally done via an application programming interface (API)......",14070,,,0,4

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

In this particular video we will load banglore home prices data into pandas dataframe and than handle NA values. We will than removal some unnecessary features and also normalize property size. We will convert the range of property size (such as 2100-3250) into an average of min and max.

We mostly identify a person in a photo with a face. Hence we will use opencv and a technique called haar cascades to detect if a face and two eyes are clearly visible or not. If they are than we keep the image otherwise we discard the image. Majority of the data cleaning work will be done using python code but there will be some cleaning work that we will have to do manually.

What Is a Data Warehouse? Data warehousing is one of the hottest topics both in business and in data science. But if you‚Äôre new to the field, you‚Äôre probably wondering what a data warehouse is, why we need it, and how it works. Don‚Äôt worry because in 4 minutes you‚Äôll know the answers to all these questions.

First, let‚Äôs start with a definition: what is the meaning of the phrase: ‚ÄòSingle source of truth‚Äô. In information systems theory, the ‚Äòsingle source of truth‚Äô is the practice of structuring all the best quality data in one place.

But what if you knew that there is one single place where you would always have the single source of information? That would be quite helpful wouldn‚Äôt it? Well, a data warehouse exists to fill that need.

So, what is a data warehouse exactly? It is the place where companies store their valuable data assets, including customer data, sales data, employee data, and so on. In short, a data warehouse is the de facto ‚Äòsingle source of data truth‚Äô for an organization. It is usually created and used primarily for data reporting and analysis purposes.

Databases are typically structured with a defined schema. Items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Columns include attributes and rows indicate an object or entity. 

Database is typically designed to be transactional and they are not designed to perform data analytics. 

A data warehouse exists on top of several databases and used for business intelligence. Data warehouse consumes data from all these databases and creates a layer optimized to perform data analytics. Schema is done on import. 

A data lake is a centralized repository for structured and unstructured data storage.  Data lakes could be used to store raw data as is without any structure (schema).  There is no need to perform any ETL or transformation jobs on it.  You can store many types of data such images, text, files, videos. You can store machine learning models artifacts, real-time data, and analytics outputs in data lakes. Processing could be done on export so schema is defined on read.

ETL and SSIS : https://youtu.be/kWxv9E7g-JM

Business Intelligence is a technology based on customer and profit-oriented models that reduce operating costs and provide increased profitability by improving productivity, sales, service and helps to make decision-making capabilities at no time. Business Intelligence Models are based on multidimensional analysis and key performance indicators (KPI) of an enterprise

 ""A data warehouse is a subject oriented, integrated, time variant, a nonvolatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process"".

In addition to a relational/multidimensional database, a data warehouse environment often consists of an ETL solution, an OLAP engine, client analysis tools, and other applications that manage the process of gathering data and delivering it to business users.

Data Mart - Datamart is a subset of data warehouse and it supports a particular region, business unit or business function.

ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) is a process in data warehousing responsible for pulling data out of the source systems and placing it into a data warehouse.

ETL and SSIS : https://youtu.be/kWxv9E7g-JM

The Online Analytical Processing is designed to answer multi-dimensional queries, whereas the Online Transaction Processing is designed to facilitate and manage the usual business applications. While OLAP is customer-oriented, OLTP is market-oriented.
Both OLTP and OLAP are two of the common systems for the management of data. The OLTP is a category of systems that manage transaction processing. OLAP is a compilation of ways to query multi-dimensional databases

Tools for Data warehouse:

Amazon Redshift
Oracle 12c
MSBI
Informatica Data Validation.
QuerySurge.
ICEDQ.
Datagaps ETL Validator.
QualiDI.
Talend Open Studio for Data Integration.

Leaders want to make real-time decisions from fresh information even while that data is growing rapidly. Companies can no longer analyze only what happened yesterday, they need to be able to make future predictions. Cruise Automation will share how they are using BigQuery to get answers to problems that could not be solved in traditional data warehouses. Jordan will also demonstrate some of the latest BigQuery features that will make you rethink what a data warehouse can be and how it can help you focus on the analytics instead of worrying about the infrastructure.

1686,b3Ohj2k5pHc,Logical Data Warehousing for advanced analytics,Data Warehousing,2018-07-12T22:44:19Z,"Most organizations today implement different data stores to support business operations. This is a direct result of how organizations and businesses evolve, naturally, over time. As a result data ends up stored across a multitude of often heterogenous systems with limited interaction and/or interoperability between them. How is an organization then able to exploit this wealth of information when critical data lives in silos across different departments? A key aspect of effective data analytics is being able to access all of this data efficiently and easily. One option is to off-load from these disparate systems into dedicated (Hadoop) Data Lakes. But the source systems cannot be necessarily decommissioned: they are still needed to support day-to-day operations. The end result is often then a vast eco-system of data stores with different ""temperature"" data, some level of duplication and, no effective way of bringing it all together for business analytics. The concept of a Logical Data Warehouse is that of a virtualization layer that allows for accessing all of this data from a single entry point. A user does need to be concerned with where the data resides or, what interface to use to reach it. This presentation will introduce you to the capabilities behind IBM Db2 Big SQL that support implementing a logical EDW running on Hadoop. We will cover MVP features, customer experiences and best practices.

Using a combination of batch and streaming data pipelines you can leverage the Delta Lake format to provide an enterprise data warehouse at a near real-time frequency. Delta Lake eases the ETL workload by enabling ACID transactions in a warehousing environment. Coupling this with structured streaming, you can achieve a low latency data warehouse. In this talk, we'll talk about how to use Delta Lake to improve the latency of ingestion and storage of your data warehouse tables. We'll also talk about how you can use spark streaming to build the aggregations and tables that drive your data warehouse.

These tips can help you to create beautiful and educational designs. Show off your newfound skills with Visme: https://www.visme.co/make-infographics/

---

In this video, Mike Ploger will dive into five helpful data storytelling tips that show you how to create better and more persuasive data visualizations. You‚Äôll also find out how our brains process visuals and how you can use these principles to improve your charts and graphs.

A few of these data storytelling tips include:

- Our eyes don't follow a specific order, so you need to create that order.
- Our eyes first focus on what stands out, so be intentional with your focal point.
- Our eyes can only handle a few things at once, so don't overcrowd your design.

And a few more. Watch the video to find out even more about data storytelling! Then get started putting your story into your own designs. Create an infographic or a presentation that shows off everything you learned in this video: https://dashboard.visme.co/login

Humans have a powerful capacity to process visual information, skills that date far back in our evolutionary lineage. And since the advent of science, we have employed intricate visual strategies to communicate data, often utilizing design principles that draw on these basic cognitive skills. In a modern world where we have far more data than we can process, the practice of data visualization has gained even more importance. From scientific visualization to pop infographics, designers are increasingly tasked with incorporating data into the media experience. Data has emerged as such a critical part of modern life that it has entered into the realm of art, where data-driven visual experiences challenge viewers to find personal meaning from a sea of information, a task that is increasingly present in every aspect of our information-infused lives.

What is Power BI?
When looking for the answer to ‚ÄúWhat is Power BI?‚Äù, we need to look no further than the tool‚Äôs creator, Microsoft. The company defines Power BI as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.‚Äù The BI stands for ‚Äúbusiness intelligence,‚Äù and the tool gives non-technical users all the resources they need to aggregate, visualize, analyze, and share data. The business world considers Power BI one of the best drag-and-drop tools available in the industry today.

Up to this point we've discussed raw data - which are just numbers - but usually it's much more useful to represent this information with charts and graphs. There are two types of data we encounter, categorical and quantitative data, and they likewise require different types of visualizations. Today we'll focus on bar charts, pie charts, pictographs, and histograms and show you what they can and cannot tell us about their underlying data as well as some of the ways they can be misused to misinform.

Eight seconds. that‚Äôs about how long it takes to tie a shoe...the amount of time bill gates makes roughly $2,000...and just under how fast Usain Bolt runs 100 meters! It‚Äôs also how long the average human‚Äôs attention span is. And when it comes to plain, dry business intelligence reports, it‚Äôs likely even shorter.

Studies show that one of the most fundamental ways to help people today cope with information overload is to visualize it. In layman‚Äôs terms, this means drawing it out as a graph, plotting it on a map or even using data to create an interactive diagram.

By mapping out data visually, it is not only easier to digest and understand important information, it is easier to discover key patterns, significant trends and compelling correlations which may have otherwise been challenging to unveil.

Bottom line: you don‚Äôt just understand what‚Äôs happening; you understand why.

In this video, Mike with Visme shows you how to present data visually for:

1. Accounting Departments
- Expense Reports
- Financial Dashboards

2. Marketing and Sales Departments
- Engagement Trends
- CRM Snapshots

3. Human Resource Departments
- Learning Management Reports
- Hiring Source Reports

4. Tech Teams
5. Leadership

Transform boring business reports into visually engaging masterpieces with these data visualization tips.

This popularity is due, in part, to R‚Äôs rich and powerful data visualization capabilities. While tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau are often the go-to solutions for data visualizations, none of these tools can compete with R in terms of the sheer breadth of, and control over, crafted data visualizations.  

As an example, R‚Äôs ggplot2 package provides the R programmer with dozens of print-quality visualizations ‚Äì where any visualization can be heavily customized with a minimal amount of code. 

In this webinar we will provide an introduction to data visualization with the ggplot2 package. The focus of the webinar will be using ggplot2 to analyze your data visually with a specific focus on discovering the underlying signals/patterns of your business. 

Attendees will learn how to: 

‚Ä¢ Craft ggplot visualizations, including customization of rendered output. 

‚Ä¢ Choose optimal visualizations for the type of data and the nature of the analysis at hand. 

‚Ä¢ Leverage ggplot2‚Äôs powerful segmentation capabilities to achieve ‚Äúvisual drill-in of data‚Äù. 

‚Ä¢ Export ggplot2 visualizations from RStudio for use in documents and presentations.

Data mining is the process of analysing data from different perspectives and summarising it into useful information, including discovery of previously unknown interesting patterns, unusual records or dependencies.

There are many potential business benefits from effective data mining, including:

Identifying previously unseen relationships between business data sets
Better predicting future trends & behaviours
Extract commercial (e.g. performance insights) from big data sets
Generating actionable strategies built on data insights (e.g. positioning and targeting for market segments)

Data mining is a particularly powerful series of techniques to support marketing competitiveness.

Examples include:

Sales forecasting: analysing when customers bought to predict when they will buy again

Database marketing: examining customer purchasing patterns and looking at the demographics and psychographics of customers to build predictive profiles

Market segmentation: a classic use of data mining, using data to break down a market into meaningful segments like age, income, occupation or gender

E-commerce basket analysis: using mined data to predict future customer behavior by past performance, including purchases and preferences

Hi, I'm Ted. I'm the instructor for this intro text mining course. Let's kick things off by defining text mining and quickly covering two text mining approaches.

Academic text mining definitions are long, but I prefer a more practical approach. So text mining is simply the process of distilling actionable insights from text. Here we have a satellite image of San Diego overlaid with social media pictures and traffic information for the roads. It is simply too much information to help you navigate around town. This is like a bunch of text that you couldn‚Äôt possibly read and organize quickly, like a million tweets or the entire works of Shakespeare. You‚Äôre drinking from a firehose! So in this example if you need directions to get around San Diego, you need to reduce the information in the map. Text mining works in the same way. You can text mine a bunch of tweets or of all of Shakespeare to reduce the information just like this map. Reducing the information helps you navigate and draw out the important features.

This is a text mining workflow. After defining your problem statement you transition from an unorganized state to an organized state, finally reaching an insight. In chapter 4, you'll use this in a case study comparing google and amazon.

The text mining workflow can be broken up into 6 distinct components. Each step is important and helps to ensure you have a smooth transition from an unorganized state to an organized state. This helps you stay organized and increases your chances of a meaningful output.

The first step involves problem definition. This lays the foundation for your text mining project. Next is defining the text you will use as your data. As with any analytical project it is important to understand the medium and data integrity because these can effect outcomes. Next you organize the text, maybe by author or chronologically.

Step 4 is feature extraction. This can be calculating sentiment or in our case extracting word tokens into various matrices. Step 5 is to perform some analysis. This course will help show you some basic analytical methods that can be applied to text. Lastly, step 6 is the one in which you hopefully answer your problem questions, reach an insight or conclusion, or in the case of predictive modeling produce an output.

Now let‚Äôs learn about two approaches to text mining. The first is semantic parsing based on word syntax. In semantic parsing you care about word type and order. This method creates a lot of features to study. For example a single word can be tagged as part of a sentence, then a noun and also a proper noun or named entity. So that single word has three features associated with it. This effect makes semantic parsing ""feature rich"". To do the tagging, semantic parsing follows a tree structure to continually break up the text.

In contrast, the bag of words method doesn‚Äôt care about word type or order. Here, words are just attributes of the document. In this example we parse the sentence ""Steph Curry missed a tough shot"". In the semantic example you see how words are broken down from the sentence, to noun and verb phrases and ultimately into unique attributes.

Bag of words treats each term as just a single token in the sentence no matter the type or order. For this introductory course, we‚Äôll focus on bag of words, but will cover more advanced methods in later courses!

Let‚Äôs get a quick taste of text mining!",47762,281,8,0,4

Text mining, also referred to as text data mining, roughly equivalent to text analytics, is the process of deriving high-quality information from text. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interestingness. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities).

Text analysis involves information retrieval, lexical analysis to study word frequency distributions, pattern recognition, tagging/annotation, information extraction, data mining techniques including link and association analysis, visualization, and predictive analytics. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of natural language processing (NLP) and analytical methods.

A typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and either model the document set for predictive classification purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.

The term text analytics describes a set of linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for business intelligence, exploratory data analysis, research, or investigation. The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, Ronen Feldman modified a 2000 description of ""text mining"" in 2004 to describe ""text analytics."" The latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while ""text mining"" is used in some of the earliest application areas, dating to the 1980s, notably life-sciences research and government intelligence.

The term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems, whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded, numerical data. It is a truism that 80 percent of business-relevant information originates in unstructured form, primarily text. These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge ‚Äì facts, business rules, and relationships ‚Äì that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.",6310,,,0,1

1815,wFz1n-z_dvY,Webinar: Introduction to Text-Mining,Text Mining,2020-06-05T15:03:13Z,"Text-mining is one of many data-mining techniques that social scientists are using to turn unstructured (or more accurately, semi-unstructured) material into structured material that can be analysed statistically. In this way, researchers are gaining access to new materials and methods that were previously unavailable. As such, it is increasingly important that social scientists have a clear understanding of what text-mining is (and what is isn't) as well as how to use text-mining to achieve some basic and more advanced research outcomes.

This free webinar, organised by the UK Data Service, is the first in a series of three on understanding and using text-mining methods within social science research contexts.

The first webinar covers the concepts behind fully structured and semi-unstructured data, the theory behind capturing and amplifying existing structure, and the four basic steps involved in any text-mining project.",734,9,0,0,0

Text Mining in Python, in other words, Text Data Mining is the process of delivering high-quality information from the texts undergoing a complete data life-cycle process. From the collection of data to the deployment of the solution, there are a series of operations every data scientist goes through to bring more clarity while understanding the patterns of the data. This tutorial is for both new learners and advanced learners to become a cog under the huge domain of Data Science. By the end of the course, learners will have basic knowledge of clustering in machine learning and K-means clustering examples in data mining.

What is Clustering?
--------------------------

Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that we use to draw reference from datasets consisting of input data without labeled response. In simple words, clustering is the method of collection of data based on similarity and dissimilarity between them. Various topics like K-Means Clustering Algorithm is the simplest unsupervised learning that makes clustering problems so easy.

Prukalpa Sankar reimagines a world where we can catch criminals at the scene of the crime ‚Äì not years later, reroute cars in real time to prevent traffic congestion that we all hate so much, predict if a child is going to drop out of school before they even knows it and eradicate a disease as it breaks, not 1000s of deaths later.


Prukalpa is the co-founder of Atlan (www.atlan.com), a data intelligence company. Their platform brings the entire decision-making process to one place ‚Äî from collecting primary data and accessing secondary data to merging internal data and visualizing data via easy-to-use dashboards.

Why Learn Hadoop? Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

1864,tkOwlXUaGMM,What is Big Data? (2019),Big Data,2014-07-07T20:09:00Z,"What is Big Data (2018)? (In 5 mins)

Big Data basically refers to, huge volume of data that cannot be, stored and processed using the traditional approach within the given time frame.

The next big question that comes to our mind is?
How huge this data needs to be? In order to be classified as Big Data?
There is a lot of misconception, while referring the term Big Data.
We usually use the term big data, to refer to the data, that is, either in gigabytes or terabytes or petabytes or exabytes or anything that is larger than this in size.
This does not defines the term Big Data completely.
Even a small amount of data can be referred to as Big Data depending on the context it is used.

Let me take an example and try to explain it to you.
For instance if we try to attach a document that is of 100 megabytes in size to an email we would not be able to do so.
As the email system would not support an attachment of this size.
Therefore this 100 megabytes of attachment with respect to email can be referred to as Big Data.

Let me take another example and try to explain the term Big Data.
Let us say we have around 10 terabytes of image files, upon which certain processing needs to be done.
For instance we may want to resize and enhance these images within a given time frame.
Suppose if we make use of the traditional system to perform this task.
We would not be able to accomplish this task within the given time frame.
As the computing resources of the traditional system would not be sufficient to accomplish this task on time.
Therefore this 10 terabytes of image files can be referred to as Big Data.

Now let us try to understand Big Data using some real world examples.
I believe you all might be aware of some the popular social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Plus and YouTube.
Each of this site, receives huge volume of data on a daily basis.
It has been reported on some of the popular tech blogs that.
Facebook alone receives around 100 terabytes of data each day.
Whereas Twitter processes around 400 million tweets each day.
As far as LinkedIn and Google Plus are concerned each of the site receives tens of terabytes of data on a daily basis.
And finally coming to YouTube, it has been reported that, each minute around 48 hours of fresh videos are uploaded to YouTube.
You can just imagine, how much volume of data is being stored and processed on these sites.
But as the number of users keep growing on these sites, storing and processing this data becomes a challenging task.
Since this data holds a lot of valuable information, this data needs to be processed in a short span of time.
By using this valuable information, companies can boost their sales and generate more revenue.
By making using of the traditional computing system, we would not be able to accomplish this task within the given time frame, as the computing resources of the traditional system would not be sufficient for processing and storing, such a huge volume of data.
This is where Hadoop comes into picture, we would be discussing Hadoop in more detail in the later sessions.
Therefore we can term this huge volume of data as Big Data.

Let me take another real world example related to the airline industry and try to explain the term Big Data.
For instance the aircrafts, while they are flying keep transmitting data to the air traffic control located at the airports.
The air traffic control uses this data to track and monitor the status and progress of the flight on a real time basis.
Since multiple aircrafts would be transmitting this data simultaneously to the air traffic control.
A huge volume of data gets accumulated at the air traffic control within a short span of time.
Therefore it becomes a challenging task to manage and process this huge volume of data using the traditional approach.
Hence we can term this huge volume of data as Big Data.

I hope you all might have understood, ""What is Big Data"".

A Business Analyst is a person who uses data to help organizations make informed business decisions while a Data Analyst is someone who collects, analyzes and interprets numeric data to turn it into meaningful language easily understood by people. This is then used by the upper management to make practical and concrete business decisions. 

Their job profile may look similar in the sense that they both help in decision making but the role of each is different. Our Data Analyst vs Business Analyst video will help you understand major differences in two. Business Analyst‚Äôs main job role includes understanding the requirements of the business and then solving and optimizing the problems through data analysis. On the other hand, Data Analysts‚Äô main tasks include gathering and manipulating the data using statistical tools and deducing them in forms of graphs, charts, and histograms. 

Also, there is a difference between the skills set of data analysts and business analysts. The skills required by data analysts are more technical. It includes Data warehousing, programming knowledge such as Python and R language, Adobe and Google Analytics, SQL knowledge and database/spreadsheet knowledge. While an ideal skill set for a business analyst includes, analytical thinking skills, communication, and leadership skills. 
However, both business analysts and data analysts should be problem-solvers and should have a good hand at Data Analysis. 

Still not clear about the basic differences in Data Analyst vs Business Analyst and have few questions about this? You need not worry. Drop your queries in the comment section and we will surely get back to you.

Hi Friends, I am Anshul Tiwari, and welcome to our youtube channel ITkFunde.

More about this video -  
After discussing datalake, data warehouse, data vault, and data streaming, we will now understand what is Business Intelligence (BI), What is Analytics, and How BI is different from analytics. BI and Analytics are a crucial part of the Data Management paradigm.

There is a very subtle difference between BI and Analytics and both these concepts are so closely related that we hardly come to know when we moved from doing BI to performing analytics.

Business intelligence (BI) works on past and present while analytics gives us insight into the future however analytics can only be done with BI as a base. We will in this youtube video cover the following -

1] What is BI?
2] What is Analytics?
3] Real-life example to understand BI vs Analytics difference
4] Business case example 
5] Famous BI and analytics products - SAP BO, SAP BI, Tibco, tableau, salesforce einstein analytics, qlick, etc.

So, who is the BI analyst and what makes them so special?

BI analysts are fierce business performance ninjas who possess a blend of business vision, consultant abilities and profound understanding of data. They join forces with senior management to shape and develop a data strategy. Analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), accurate overview of business performance and identifying areas that need improvement are also specialties in the BI analyst‚Äôs domain.

And what exactly do BI analysts do?

Well, they focus primarily on analyses and reporting of past historical data. Once the relevant data is in the hands of the BI Analyst (that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ monthly revenue, customer, sales volume, etc.), they must quantify the observations, calculate KPIs, and examine the measures to extract insights.

Of course, the most important aspect of a BI analyst‚Äôs job is to continually improve their company‚Äôs competitive positioning. Therefore, they examine their competitors, data trends, seasonality, and other random effects to quickly identify issues and best practices.
On top of that, they create killer graphs and dashboards to review major decisions and measure effectiveness. So, in a word, if you want to have an impact on the business world, become a BI analyst.

Well, maybe that‚Äôs easier said than done. But let‚Äôs see how much a BI analyst makes per year, maybe that‚Äôll have some inspirational effect on you‚Ä¶

At some point each one of us must have wondered where all the recommendations that Netflix, Amazon, Google give us, come from. We often rate products on the internet and all the preferences we express and data we share (explicitly or not), are used by recommender systems to generate, in fact, recommendations.

In this hands-on workshop we will understand basics of a recommendation system and also build our own. We will be building a content based recommendation engine using Python and Scikitlearn. We will cover concepts such as cosine distance, euclidean distance and when to use each of them. Finally, we will use IMDB 5000 movie dataset to build a content based recommendation engine using CountVectorize and Cosine similarity scores between movies.

This talk walks through the steps involved in building a recommendation pipeline, from data cleaning, hyperparameter tuning, model training and evaluation.

Personalized recommendation systems play an integral role in e-commerce platforms, with the goal of driving user engagement. While there is extensive literature on the theory behind recommendation systems, there is limited material that describes the underlying infrastructure of a recommendation system pipeline. In this talk, we will walk through the process of designing and building a recommendation system pipeline. We will specifically discuss techniques for data cleaning and normalization, hyperparameter tuning, model training and fitting, as well as quantitative and qualitative model evaluation. By the end of this talk, you will learn how to design your own recommendation system pipeline from scratch.

Most big tech companies use a Recommender System in one way or another. You can find them anywhere from Amazon (product recommendations) to YouTube (video recommendations) to Facebook (friend recommendations). The ability to recommend relevant products or services to users can be a huge boost for a company, which is why it's so common to find this technique employed on so many sites. Learning about these systems will help you gain an advantage and help you work on hands-on projects that can make your data science resume attractive. Here are a few related blogs on the topic:

Abstract
Food recommender systems typically rely on popularity, as well as similarity between recipes to generate personalized suggestions. However, this leaves little room for users to explore new preferences, such as to adopt healthier eating habits.In this short paper, we present a recommendation strategy based on knowledge about food and users' health-related characteristics to generate personalized recipes suggestions. By focusing on personal factors as a user's BMI and dietary constraints, we exploited a holistic user model to re-rank a basic recommendation list of 4,671 recipes, and investigated in a web-based experiment (N=200) to what extent it generated satisfactory food recommendations. We found that some of the information encoded in a users' holistic user profiles affected their preferences, thus providing us with interesting findings to continue this line of research.

SVD was one of the winning algorithms in the Netflix Prize and produces great results in recommender systems to this day.

You'll need to understand Principal Component Analysis (PCA) first, as this video concentrates on how PCA can be extended to the problem of matrix factorization for combining latent factors that produce personalized recommendations for a given user or item.

Abstract

In the past, news recommender systems have been built to recommend list of news items similar to those that a user has accessed before (content-based); or similar to those that have been read by similar users (collaborative filtering). However, the highly volatile nature of the news content and the dynamic and evolving user preferences are either ignored or not taken into full consideration in these systems. In a news recommender system, it is very likely that a user‚Äôs short-term interest or preference may have a sudden change due to an emerging social or personal event or breaking news while their long-term interests may change gradually or remain. For these long-term interests of the readers, it is often more appropriate to associate them with news categories than with individual news items. In this paper, we propose a biased matrix factorization model with consideration of both temporal dynamics of user preferences and news taxonomy to build a news recommender system. By conducting an extensive experiment on a collection of news data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model against traditional matrix factorization models as well as other neural recommender baselines. The findings from our experiments show that news category is an important factor when readers choose news articles to read, and temporal factors with consideration of different temporal resolution also play a role in this process.",784,18,0,0,3

Speaker: Joe Konstan
Date: 10/8/19

ABSTRACT

Recommender systems help users find items of interest and help websites and marketers select items to promote. Today's recommender systems incorporate sophisticated technology to model user preferences, model item properties, and leverage the experiences of a large community of users in the service of better recommendations. Yet all too often better recommendations‚Äîat least by traditional measures of accuracy and precision‚Äîfail to meet the goal of improving user experience. This talk will take a look at successes and failures in moving beyond basic machine learning approaches to recommender systems to emphasize factors tied to user behavior and experience. Along the way, we will explore approaches to combining human-centered evaluation with data mining and machine learning techniques.

Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems.  A tree has many analogies in real life, and turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning, covering both classification and regression trees (CART).

So a decision tree is a flow-chart-like structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of a test, and each leaf (or terminal) node holds a class label. The topmost node in a tree is the root node.

Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a data set into smaller and smaller subsets and simultaneously decision tree is incrementally developed. The final tree is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node has two or more branches. Leaf node represents a classification or decision. We cannot do more split on leaf nodes.

The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.
#codewrestling #decisiontree #machinelearning #id3
Common terms used with Decision trees:

Root Node: It represents entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.

Splitting: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.

Decision Node: When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called decision node.

Leaf/ Terminal Node: Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node.

Pruning: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say opposite process of splitting.

Branch / Sub-Tree: A sub section of entire tree is called branch or sub-tree.

Parent and Child Node: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes whereas sub-nodes are the child of parent node.

How does Decision Tree works ?

Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter / differentiator in input variables.

Advantages of Decision Tree:

1. Easy to Understand: Decision tree output is very easy to understand even for people from non-analytical background. It does not require any statistical knowledge to read and interpret them. Its graphical representation is very intuitive and users can easily relate their hypothesis.
2. Useful in Data exploration: Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables. With the help of decision trees, we can create new variables / features that has better power to predict target variable. It can also be used in data exploration stage. For e.g., we are working on a problem where we have information available in hundreds of variables, there decision tree will help to identify most significant variable.
3 Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection.
4. Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation.
5. Less data cleaning required: It requires less data cleaning compared to some other modeling techniques. It is not influenced by outliers and missing values to a fair degree.
6. Data type is not a constraint: It can handle both numerical and categorical variables. Can also handle multi-output problems.

ID3 Algorithm

Key Factors:
Entropy- It is the measure of randomness or ‚Äòimpurity‚Äô in the dataset.
Information Gain: It is the measure of decrease in entropy after the dataset is split.

About this video:
A Decision Tree recursively splits training data into subsets based on the value of a single attribute. Each split corresponds to a node in the. Splitting stops when every subset is pure (all elements belong to a single class) -- this can always be achieved, unless there are duplicate training examples with different classes.

This Decision Tree in R tutorial video will help you understand what is decision tree, what problems can be solved using decision trees, how does a decision tree work and you will also see a use case implementation in which we do survival prediction using R. Decision tree is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms in use today, this is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classifying problems. It works well classifying for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets based on the most significant attributes/ independent variables. In simple words, a decision tree is a tree-shaped algorithm used to determine a course of action. Each branch of the tree represents a possible decision, occurrence or reaction. Now let us get started and understand how does Decision tree work.

Below topics are explained in this Decision tree in R tutorial :
1. What is Decision tree?
2. What problems can be solved using Decision Trees?
3. How does a Decision Tree work?
4. Use case: Survival prediction in R

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks, spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

As this is a complex concept, we have tried our best to simplify it as much as possible in a limited duration video. We take the help of a child as example and try to understand the complex neural network with the help of this child. This video also demonstrated how neural network works by taking an example of Image Recognition. It shows how values are calculated at each step, how the output is generated and how using back propagation the neural net adjusts its weights and values.

Hope this video helps!

This clip and the next could open your eyes to their awesome capabilities! You'll get a closer look at neural nets without any of the math or code - just what they are and how they work. Soon you'll understand why they are such a powerful tool!

Deep Learning is primarily about neural networks, where a network is an interconnected web of nodes and edges. Neural nets were designed to perform complex tasks, such as the task of placing objects into categories based on a few attributes. This process, known as classification, is the focus of our series.

Classification involves taking a set of objects and some data features that describe them, and placing them into categories. This is done by a classifier which takes the data features as input and assigns a value (typically between 0 and 1) to each object; this is called firing or activation; a high score means one class and a low score means another. There are many different types of classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Na√Øve Bayes. If you have used any of these tools before, which one is your favorite? Please comment.

Neural nets are highly structured networks, and have three kinds of layers - an input, an output, and so called hidden layers, which refer to any layers between the input and the output layers. Each node (also called a neuron) in the hidden and output layers has a classifier. The input neurons first receive the data features of the object. After processing the data, they send their output to the first hidden layer. The hidden layer processes this output and sends the results to the next hidden layer. This continues until the data reaches the final output layer, where the output value determines the object's classification. This entire process is known as Forward Propagation, or Forward prop. The scores at the output layer determine which class a set of inputs belongs to.

Have you worked with neural nets before? If not, is this clear so far? Please comment.
Neural nets are sometimes called a Multilayer Perceptron or MLP. This is a little confusing since the perceptron refers to one of the original neural networks, which had limited activation capabilities. However, the term has stuck - your typical vanilla neural net is referred to as an MLP.

Before a neuron fires its output to the next neuron in the network, it must first process the input. To do so, it performs a basic calculation with the input and two other numbers, referred to as the weight and the bias. These two numbers are changed as the neural network is trained on a set of test samples. If the accuracy is low, the weight and bias numbers are tweaked slightly until the accuracy slowly improves. Once the neural network is properly trained, its accuracy can be as high as 95%.

An Introduction to Graph Neural Networks: Models and Applications

Got it now: ""Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are a general class of networks that work over graphs. By representing a problem as a graph ‚Äî encoding the information of individual elements as nodes and their relationships as edges ‚Äî GNNs learn to capture patterns within the graph. These networks have been successfully used in applications such as chemistry and program analysis. In this introductory talk, I will do a deep dive in the neural message-passing GNNs, and show how to create a simple GNN implementation. Finally, I will illustrate how GNNs have been used in applications.

Other times you may see it referenced as bias nodes, bias neurons, or bias units within a neural network. We're going to break this bias down and see what it's all about.

We'll first start out by discussing the most obvious question of, well, what is bias in an artificial neural network? We'll then see, within a network, how bias is implemented. Then, to hit the point home, we'll explore a simple example to illustrate the impact that bias has when introduced to a neural network.

2110,h7apO7q16V0,The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Most Ingenious Algorithm Ever?,Algorithms,2020-11-14T22:03:14Z,"In this video, we take a look at one of the most beautiful algorithms ever created: the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This is a tricky algorithm to understand so we take a look at it in a context that we are all familiar with: polynomial multiplication. You will see how the core ideas of the FFT can be ""discovered"" through asking the right questions. The key insights that are presented in this video is that polynomial multiplication can be improved significantly by multiplying polynomials in a special value representation. The challenge that presents itself is the problem of converting a polynomial from a standard coefficient representation to value representation. 

We see that the FFT is an incredibly efficient recursive algorithm that performs this task, and we also discover that a slightly tweaked FFT (Inverse FFT) can also solve the reverse problem of interpolation. If this video doesn't blow your mind, I don't know what will.

3:36 Polynomial Representation
6:06 Value Representation Advantages
7:07 Polynomial Multiplication Flowchart
8:04 Polynomial Evaluation
13:49 Which Evaluation Points?
16:30 Why Nth Roots of Unity?
18:28 FFT Implementation
22:47 Interpolation and Inverse FFT
26:49 Recap

Also a subtle mistake that a commenter made me aware of -- at 26:40 instead of replacing w with (1/n * e^{-2 * pi i/ n}), the actual right way to do this is by taking the final output of the IFFT at the end of the recursion and dividing by n. 

So the full change is w = e^{-2 pi i / n} 
And then somewhere outside the scope of the IFFT function ifft_result = 1/n * IFFT(values)

The treatment of the FFT in this video is inspired by several well known references, mainly Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen et al.) and Algorithms (Papadimitriou et al.).

I will try to explain what genetic algorithms using an example. And we will look at different applications of this evolutionary algorithm. We will also try to solve one historic problem in computer science by example: The Knapsack problem.

Genetic algorithms are a subgroup of evolutionary algorithms or evolutionary computing and they are used in self-learning machine learning algorithms and AI. They use the concept of natural selection to simulate the survival of the fittest and natural selection inside your computer.

2126,n4L5hHFcGVk,Sentiment Analysis: extracting emotion through machine learning | Andy Kim | TEDxDeerfield,Sentimental Analysis,2020-09-10T16:10:10Z,"My research uses Twitter data to train a model that predicts sentiments in comments on online platforms like Reddit or Facebook, giving insight into these, otherwise anonymous, users' thoughts. I would also detail how the model was built and challenges faced along the way. This would lead to a short concluding discussion on the broad possibilities of this technology, ranging from detecting radicalization on the web to customer reviews on Amazon. This would relate it back to real-world applications that matter to everyone, not just those in the tech sphere. 
 Andy Kim is a junior at Deerfield Academy. Ever since coding for the first time in elementary school, Andy has been passionate about all things computer science. He has pursued research in a variety of fields, including astrophysics, facial recognition, as well as sentiment analysis, the topic of his talk. 
Andy is fascinated with harnessing the power of machine learning to analyze human communication. He believes as more and more of our lives become digitized, sentiment analysis will become a valuable tool in evaluating our digital interactions.

But they should know about Types of Analysis in Forex Trading, different types of analysis in forex trading, sentiment analysis in forex trading, sentimental analysis in forex trading, 
If you are a beginner then you must have to search for fundamental analysis forex for beginners. fundamental analysis forex for beginners makes you easy to understand the types of Analysis in Forex Trading. 

Market analysts and traders are constantly innovating and improving upon strategies to devise new analytical methods for understanding currency market movements.
I am on this channel give you a detail information on forex trading analysis. 
00:00 - Introduction to Analysis 
00:31 - Types of Analysis in Forex Trading. 
00:46 - Technical Analysis in Forex Trading
01:48 - Fundamental Analysis in Forex Trading
02:56 - Sentimental Analysis in Forex Trading

If we were to find out the total number of trading strategies or types, there are many.
Every other trader out there uses a different kind of strategy.
But all the strategies fall under three types of analysis.
1) Technical analysis
2) Fundamental analysis
3) Sentimental analysis.

In this video, we will learn about different types of analysis in forex trading. And it is not difficult to understand the different types of analysis in forex trading, sentiment analysis in forex trading, sentimental analysis in forex trading, detail information on forex trading sentimental analysis.

1) Technical analysis. What is Technical analysis

Technical analysis is one of the most widely used types of analysis in the forex market.
In technical analysis, traders study the price movement.

In technical analysis, a person can look at historical price movements and determine the current trading conditions and potential price movement.
Now there are different types of strategies under this kind of analysis and there are different tools and indicators which technical traders use.

2) Fundamental analysis. What is Fundamental analysis

Every country has different economic news scheduled throughout the day and this news directly reflects the condition of the economy of the country.

So, if the country's economy is weak, the currency will be weak and if a country's economy is strong then the currency will be strong.
Take a look at example in which I have given detail information on forex trading analysis.
For example, let us say you are trading on USD/JPY.
You did your fundamental analysis and got to know that USD is going to get stronger and JPY is going to get weak.
So, what you will do is, open a buy trade on USD/JPY that is buying USD.

So, many traders use the news to do the complete analysis and predict if the economy of a country is going to get strong or weak. And based on this they predict future price movements in the forex market.
The traders who use fundamental analysis to place a trade are called fundamental traders.

3) Sentimental analysis. What is Sentimental analysis

There are millions of traders out there in the forex market and every trader has its own belief and bias.
Like at some point in the market there are traders who buy and at the same point there are traders who sell.
The outcome of where the price will move depends upon the number of buyers and sellers present in any market.
Like, at some point if the buyers are more than the sellers then the price will move up and if at some point the sellers are more than the buyers then the price will move down.

In the sentimental analysis, the traders look for the data of what other traders feel about a particular currency pair and then look out for what is the bias of most of the traders.
If the buyer is more then they look for a buying opportunity and if sellers are more then they look for a selling opportunity. So here I have share all detail information on forex trading sentimental analysis with forex trading sentiment analysis with an example. And now I am sure that you understand the important of forex trading analysis and how forex trading important analysis. 
So study the all Types of Analysis in Forex Trading. Types of Analysis in Forex Trading video will give you all answer of your questions.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

This project is done according to the IBM Hack challenge 2020.

In this project, our server application subscribes to a Twitter feed with hashtags of ""Covid19"". Each tweet received will be analyzed for emotional tone and sentiment, and the intent of the tweet will be determined by the Watson Assistant service. All data is stored in a Cloudant database. The resulting analysis is presented in a web-framework (dashboard) as a series of graphs and charts.

Steps the project follows: -
1) Tweets are pushed out by Twitter.
2) The Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets app processes the tweet.
3) The Watson Tone Analyzer Service performs analysis of sentiment and 4) emotional tone.
4) The Watson Natural Language Understanding Service pulls out keywords and entities.
5) The Watson Assistant Service extracts the intents (verbs) from the tweets.
6) Tweets and metadata are stored in Cloudant
7) The dashboard displays charts and graphs as well as the tweets.

Mostly,people will make a comment on social media or leave a review on the product page to let the public know what they are thinking. Through those feedback, company or authorities can respond and further improve their product and services.
The model takes the text as input, pre-processes the text and sends it to the neural network. The neural network classifies the text as 0 or 1 based on whether the text is negative or positive respectively.Using this the sentiment of the person who is sending the tweet can be understood and tweet can be analysed.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Transcript/notes
Probability basic concepts
Rolling a die, drawing a card out of a deck and flipping a coin are all things we are familiar with, and these are often used to discuss the basic concepts of probability. 
 
There are 4 key terms that are often used with probability, a probability experiment, which is a process where specific results are obtained, such as rolling a die, as there are only 6 possible outcomes.

And outcome is another key term, which is a single result of a probability experiment, so, if you draw a 4 of hearts from a full deck of cards, that is an outcome.

Sample space is another key term, and it is the set of all possible outcomes for a probability experiment.  For instance, the sample space for rolling 2 dice is here, you can see the possible outcomes for die 1 and the possible outcomes for die number 2, and the sample space is the pairs of numbers listed on the chart here, so, there are 36 possible outcomes in this sample space.

Event is another key term used in probability, and an event is the set of outcomes of a probability experiment, it is a subset of the sample space, and an event with one outcome is a simple event, and a compound event consists of 2 or more outcomes.  For instance, the event of rolling a 4 on a die roll is a simple event, and the event of getting an even number on a die roll is a compound event.

There are 3 main types of probability, classical probability, empirical probability, and subjective probability.  

Classical probability is used when each outcome in a sample space is equally likely to occur, for instance the sample space for rolling 2 dice, and each of these outcomes has the same chance to occur.  The formula for this is P of E, probability of any event equals number of outcomes in event E divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.  So the probability of the 2 dice totaling 5 is P of 5 equals 4 divided by 36, the total number of outcomes in the sample space.

Empirical probability is when each outcome is not equally likely to occur and it is based on observations obtained from experiments.  For instance, lets say you polled 50 people and asked them what their favorite sport is.  Using a frequency table, 29 said football, 11 said basketball, 6 said baseball, 3 said soccer, and 1 said tennis.  Now we can compute probabilities for each of the categories.  

The formula for empirical probability is probability of event equals frequency for the class or the event,  divided by the total of the frequencies.  So the probability of football being a person‚Äôs favorite sport is 29 divided by 50, which is 0.58, and the probability of tennis being someone‚Äôs favorite sport is 1 divided by 50, which is 0.02.  And you can convert these to percentages by multiplying by 100 to get 58% and 2%.

Subjective probability is based on an educated guess or an estimate.  If I were to say there is a 73% chance the Yankees win the World Series next year, this is based on my experience and evaluation.

And there are 4 key rules to probability.  The first is that the probability of any event is between 0 and 1, including 0 and 1, and this is written as 0 less than or equal to probability of an event, less than or equal to 1.  

And whatever the value of P is, can be written as a fraction or a decimal.  For instance, the probability of getting a head on a coin toss is 0.5, or 1 over 2.

Rule number 2 is the total sum of all possible outcomes in a sample space is 1.  So, the sample space for a die roll is 1 through 6, with each having a 1 over 6 probability of occurring, add these up and we get 1.

Rule number 3 is if it is impossible for a given event to occur, so it is not part of the sample space, its probability is zero.  For instance the probability of rolling a 8 on a die roll is not part of the sample space, so its probability is zero.

Rule number 4 is that if an event is certain to occur, its probability is 1.  So, the probability of rolling a 1 through a 6 on a die roll is certain to happen, so its probability is 1.

This video gives an overview on basic probability calculations dividing it into 4 topics- simple probability, joint probability, marginal probability & the additional rule. Probability means the possibility, likelihood or chance to happen a particular event out of two or more events. Simple probability refers to the probability that a simple event will occur and there will not be any pre-conditions. The video then explains simple probability through an example.

Moving on, the video explains joint probability that involves the probability of 2 or more events by using a simple example where it asks to find out the probability of rain in today & tomorrow. Next, the video explains marginal probability that refers a set of joint probabilities & introduces the concept of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events. Finally, the video discusses on the additional rule & shows how to calculate the probability of either any of two events from their individual probability and combined probability.",96348,617,50,0,27

2209,ibINrxJLvlM,Intro to Conditional Probability,Probability In Statistics,2017-11-19T00:46:12Z,"What is the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred? We call this conditional probability, and it is governed by the formula that P(A|B) which reads ""probability of A given B"" is equal to the P(A intersect B)/P(B). We look at an example involving the probability of being an alcoholic given that one is a man. 

Conditional Probability Formula: P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B)

So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

This is an overview of some basic forecasting methods. These basic forecasting methods are broken into two categories of approaches: Quantitative and Qualitative. 

Quantitative forecasting approaches use historical data and correlative association to make forecasts. Qualitative forecasting approaches look at the opinions of experts, consumers, decision makers, and other stakeholders.

This video is about basic forecasting methods and covers 9 of the most common approaches. Avercast forecasting software makes good use of these approaches and is powered by over 200 algorithms.",265471,1879,80,0,10

*********************    
In this video, we will explore What is Forecasting.
Our past and present situation is giving us information that we can use to predict our future and make better decisions.

Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.
Another term that is similar to Forecasting is Predicting, but it more general and less accurate than forecasting.
If you think about it almost every decision that we make is some form of forecasting as a future outcome is never certain.
You might think that you will wake up tomorrow at 5 am, but life often proves us wrong and we happened to sleep in.
Forecasting is very popular when it comes to money. It‚Äôs the way how we can stay on top of our finances.
When we forecast we plan how much money will be coming in and how much will be going out so we can make correct financial decisions.
When it comes to forecasting it‚Äôs about planning ahead. People who don‚Äôt forecast their finances end up in the debt and paying high-interest rates.
But money is not the only thing that we have to forecast. We also have to forecast how we will spend our time and energy.
People who don‚Äôt plan their time end up wasting a lot of it. While those who do usually achieve the goals that they are striving for.
To start forecasting all you have to do is to allocate some time every week to plan the upcoming week‚Äôs activities.
If you start to plan how you invest your time I can guarantee that you will be making fast progress towards your goals.

I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick summary of what Forecasting is and why it‚Äôs so important.     ________________

Forecasting in Operations Management

1) Simple Moving Average Method
A Simple Moving Average is a method of computing the average of a specified number of the most recent data values in a series.

2) Weighted Moving Average Method
A Weighted Moving Average is used to forecast the future demand. As per this method, the more recent data has more weight compared to old data.

3) Exponential Smoothing
Another form of Weighted Moving Average is the Exponential Smoothing average, This method keeps the running average of demand and adjusts it for each period in proportional to the difference between latest actual demand and latest value of forecast.

(1) MEANING OF DEMAND FORECASTING
(a) MEASURING IN ADVANCE
‚Ä¢ Forecasting, in general, refers to knowing or measuring 
‚Ä¢ the status or nature of an event or variable before it occurs. 

(b) ART AND SCIENCE OF PREDICTING THE PROBABLE DEMAND 
‚Ä¢ Forecasting of demand is 
‚Ä¢ the art and science of predicting the probable demand 
‚Ä¢ for a product or a service at some future date 
‚Ä¢ on the basis of certain past behaviour patterns 
‚Ä¢ of some related events and the prevailing trends in the present. 

(c) NOT A SIMPLE GUESS WORK 
‚Ä¢ It should be kept in mind that demand forecasting is no simple guessing,
‚Ä¢ but it refers to estimating demand scientifically and objectively 
‚Ä¢ on the basis of certain facts and events relevant to forecasting.

2258,i40Road82No,Time Series Forecasting Using Recurrent Neural Network and Vector Autoregressive Model: When and How,Forecasting,2018-10-10T13:17:30Z,"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, establishes strict guidelines for managing personal and sensitive data, backed by stiff penalties. GDPR's requirements have forced some companies to shut down services and others to flee the EU market altogether. GDPR's goal to give consumers control over their data and, thus, increase consumer trust in the digital ecosystem is laudable. However, there is a growing feeling that GDPR has dampened innovation in machine learning & AI applied to personal and/or sensitive data. After all, ML & AI are hungry for rich, detailed data and sanitizing data to improve privacy typically involves redacting or fuzzing inputs, which multiple studies have shown can seriously affect model quality and predictive power. While this is technically true for some privacy-safe modeling techniques, it's not true in general. The root cause of the problem is two-fold. First, most data scientists have never learned how to produce great models with great privacy. Second, most companies lack the systems to make privacy-safe machine learning & AI easy. This talk will challenge the implicit assumption that more privacy means worse predictions. Using practical examples from production environments involving personal and sensitive data, the speakers will introduce a wide range of techniques--from simple hashing to advanced embeddings--for high-accuracy, privacy-safe model development. Key topics include pseudonymous ID generation, semantic scrubbing, structure-preserving data fuzzing, task-specific vs. task-independent sanitization and ensuring downstream privacy in multi-party collaborations. Special attention will be given to Spark-based production environments.

This video in our series on forecasting methods looks at the basics of moving averages. When you create a forecast using this moving average method, you predetermine the number of periods to average to get a forecast for the next period. 

Savvy demand planners that use moving averages for supply and operations planning will often use a weighted average for specific periods. While moving averages can be an effective method of forecasting in some instances, you can get better accuracy by combining forecasting methods.

What is a data engineer?

The goals of a data engineer are much more big-picture and development focused. Data engineers build automated systems and model data structures to allow data to be efficiently processed.

This means the goal of a data engineer is to create and develop tables and data pipelines to support analytical dashboards and other data customers (like data scientists, analysts, and other engineers). 

It's similar to most engineers. There is a lot of design, assumptions, limitations, and development that occurs to be able to create some sort of final robust system.

2268,73QC3qw5b2Y,What do DATA ENGINEERS do? Is data engineering a good career choice in 2020?,Data Engineer,2020-06-11T18:04:53Z,"I currently work as a data engineer and I'd like to tell you what data engineering is all about! It's commonly confused with machine learning, data science etc., when in fact data engineering is quite a distinct area of technology.

So, what do big data engineers do?

The job revolves around bringing new data to the company (ETL process if you like) and then maintaining the data flow! 

Is data engineering a good career choice in 2020? Long story short - yes. As the amount of data we produce is growing rapidly, so is the demand for data professionals. However, my prediction is that many of the current data engineering tasks might get standardised, and eventually automated in the future. But hey, this is the XXI century! We'll have to learn new skills and adapt all the time!

2269,q9oAZwhuUy4,Data Analyst vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist,Data Engineer,2020-02-01T15:11:47Z,"Data analyst, data scientist and data engineer are three different roles in the field of data science and data analytics. And these three roles can sometimes confuse data science aspirants. In this video, we will go over the differences between the three roles, skill set required in each of these roles and salary expectations. 

What is data engineer?
Data engineer is responsible for maintaining data infrastructure, data pipelines, data warehouse, data modeling, etc. 

What is data analyst?
Data analyst uses the data warehouse to run analysis on top of it using enterprise business intelligence tools such as Tableau, Power BI, etc. He is also an expert in excel and business domain. 

What is data scientist?
Data scientist, on the other hand, has all skills of data analyst plus strong statistical skills and machine learning skills which makes him a perfect person who can build machine learning and deep learning models for predictive analysis and generate detailed insights for any business.

2275,UjYc8uH6lHw,Why NOT to become a Data Engineer,Data Engineer,2021-03-25T18:00:06Z,"I have created multiple videos about data engineering, including a data engineering course for beginners. Why would I advise anyone against pursuing a career in data engineering? I like being as transparent as possible - while this job will be great for many people, it might be disappointing for the others. In this video I'm outlining three reasons why not to become a data engineer. 

If you'd still like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview:

1. Learn Python
I recommend following the Python for Everybody specialization course on Coursera, which is one of the most popular courses there:
https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kOQH55A53NA&offerid=759505.1560499266&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fpython

2. Learn SQL
SQL is still the lingua franca of data. I recommend going with Learn SQL Basics for Data Science course, because it contains some chapters which are very releavant to data engineering in partcular, e.g. distributed computing with Spark
https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kOQH55A53NA&offerid=759505.15198708466&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Flearn-sql-basics-data-science

3. Learn Bash scripting/Linux
I wouldn't take a full course on it, but at least read a good article.
if you do prefer to take a course/guided project, I think this one is short and good:
https://www.coursera.org/projects/command-line-linux

4. Learn how to develop on the cloud, e.g. on AWS
There are a few good courses around there, but I think the Coursera one is the most comprehensive 
https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kOQH55A53NA&offerid=759505.18533796022&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Faws-fundamentals

2276,lVj0RlSxTXk,Best Online Courses For Data Engineers #dataengineer,Data Engineer,2021-04-15T14:00:28Z,"According to a recent survey by Statista, the data market is expected to grow 175 zettabytes in volume by the year 2025. In order to dive in further into big data, we need to understand how one can work on it ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where data engineering comes in.

Simply put, data engineering is all about managing big datasets and extracting information from them efficiently and accurately.
What‚Äôs a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is someone who‚Äôs responsible for maintaining and building the architecture of data in a DS project.

Some of the main roles and responsibilities of a data engineer include having to ensure an uninterrupted flow of data between server and application, integrating new data management software, improving data foundational processes, and building data pipelines.

The truth is there are lots of various technologies and concepts that data engineers need to take on ‚Äî working with cloud computing, ETLs, data warehouses, and so much more.

The requirement of data engineers is constantly expanding, and thus we constantly need to continue learning what is changing in the technology world.

In this video, we‚Äôll talk about the top courses you can take to understand how data engineering works.

https://bit.ly/3hCof6I

At a high level, data engineers help take data from point A to point B and remodel it into a format where analysts and data scientists can easily use it.

From a skills perspective, this means that data engineers specialize in ETLs (extract, transform, load), automation (usually with Python or other programming languages), data modeling/data warehousing, SQL and NoSQL data manipulation, and data visualization, to name a few.

The skills that are less known are skills like ETLs and data warehousing. Both of these are usually discussed more in master‚Äôs or certificate programs after getting your bachelor‚Äôs degree ‚Äî although we suspect this will or has already changed.

More than likely you will need to learn these skills in some form of order.

Starting with python and SQL, then ETLs and data warehousing, cloud and data viz, etc.

As a data engineer, what we need to study is not always clear. Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL, some roles require understanding statistics while still others require heavy amounts of system design.

I wanted to create a video to cover some key points for data engineer interviews. 

This video will cover points such as data warehouse design, coding and behavioral questions. I wanted to give the viewer a good high level view of what you should prepare for.

If you enjoy this video on data engineering interviews and want more details, then please comment with your requests.

This includes discussing what are the goals, skills, and tools that they use on a daily basis. We wanted to take a moment to provide insights to the other options data professionals have besides data scientists.

Data science has attracted a lot of buzz for almost the last decade. The ability to gain insights from data has driven much of the high tech companies like Facebook, Netflix and Google's success. However, it is not the only piece of the data puzzle. Quietly, in the background, behind all the models, metrics and dashboards, another type of data professional has worked to ensure data scientists have the data they need.

These are the data engineers. Data engineers work in the background managing data pipelines and data storage systems to ensure that the rest of the company can get their dashboards, metrics, and models. They use a variety of tools like SQL databases, Hadoop and Python and are proficient in data modeling and automation.

About the Speaker:
Ben is a Seattle based Data Scientist & Engineer working in San Francisco, California. He has extensive experience designing ETL pipelines, databases, websites, and other software products for startups and pre-established corporations.

Hi. My name is Vincent. I'm a Data and Software Engineer at DataCamp. If you've ever heard of data science, there's a good chance you've heard of data engineering as well. This course will help you take your first steps in the world of data engineering. All very exciting, so let's get started!.

In the first chapter, we'll start off by introducing the concept of data engineering. In the second chapter, you'll learn more about the tools data engineers use. The third chapter is all about Extracting, Transforming and Loading data, or ETL. Finally, you'll get to have a peek behind the curtain in the case study on data engineering at DataCamp. But first, let's understand what data engineers do!

Imagine this: you've been hired as a data scientist at a young startup. Tasked with predicting customer churn, you want to use a fancy machine learning technique that you have been honing for years. However, after a bit of digging around, you realize all of your data is scattered around many databases. Additionally, the data resides in tables that are optimized for applications to run, not for analyses. To make matters worse, some legacy code has caused a lot of the data to be corrupt. In your previous company, you never really had this problem, because all the data was available to you in an orderly fashion. You're getting desperate. In comes the data engineer to the rescue.

It is the data engineer's task to make your life as a data scientist easier. Do you need data that currently comes from several different sources? No problem, the data engineer extracts data from these sources and loads it into one single database ready to use. At the same time, they've optimized the database scheme so it becomes faster to query. They also removed corrupt data. In this sense, the data engineer is one of the most valuable people in a data-driven company that wants to scale up.

Back in 2015, DataCamp published an infographic on precisely this: who does what in the data science industry. In this infographic, we described a data engineer as ""an engineer that develops, constructs, tests, and maintains architectures such as databases and large-scale processing systems."" A lot has changed since then, but the definition still holds up. The data engineer is focused on processing and handling massive amounts of data, and setting up clusters of machines to do the computing.

Typically, the tasks of a data engineer consist of developing a scalable data architecture, streamlining data acquisition, setting up processes that bring data together from several sources and safeguarding data quality by cleaning up corrupt data. Typically, the data engineer also has a deep understanding of cloud technology. They generally are experienced using cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Compare this with the tasks of a data scientist, who spend their time mining for patterns in data, applying statistical models on large datasets, building predictive models using machine learning, developing tools to monitor essential business processes, or cleaning data by removing statistical outliers. Data scientist typically have a deep understanding of the business itself.

Let's see if you can recognize the qualities of a data engineer in the exercises.",8851,148,0,0,3

‚ñ∂ About this video:
The goal of a data engineer is to create and collect data. Among the primary data engineering definitions we name:
- Data pipelines - creating ways (pipelines) in which the data travels through the infrastructure
- Data modeling - creating conceptual data representations, and 
- Data wrangling - make sure that the data used in the infrastructure is valid and high-quality.

So while data engineer is into coding and development, a data scientist helps to make sense of insights that were received from data engineers. They are involved in statistical analysis and improving algorithm models",1688,53,1,0,9

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

Second, once you have formulated a hypothesis, you will have to find the right test for your hypothesis.Third, you execute the test. And fourth, you make a decision based on the result.

Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. What is a hypothesis? Though there are many ways to define it, the most intuitive I‚Äôve seen is:
‚ÄúA hypothesis is an idea that can be tested.‚Äù

This is not the formal definition, but it explains the point very well. So, if I tell you that apples in New York are expensive, this is an idea, or a statement, but is not testable, until I have something to compare it with. For instance, if I define expensive as: any price higher than $1.75 dollars per pound, then it immediately becomes a hypothesis. 
Alright, what‚Äôs something that cannot be a hypothesis? An example may be: would the USA do better or worse under a Clinton administration, compared to a Trump administration? Statistically speaking, this is an idea, but there is no data to test it, therefore it cannot be a hypothesis of a statistical test. Actually, it is more likely to be a topic of another discipline. Conversely, in statistics, we may compare different US presidencies that have already been completed, such as the Obama administration and the Bush administration, as we have data on both.  
Generally, the researcher is trying to reject the null hypothesis. Think about the null hypothesis as the status quo and the alternative as the change or innovation that challenges that status quo. In our example, Paul was representing the status quo, which we were challenging.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more.

Dr. Manishika Jain in this lecture explains the meaning of hypothesis and 13 major types of research hypothesis:

Insufficient Evidence
Can be true or false
Tentative solution to a problem
May or may not be correct
Clear
Precise
Testable
Consistent with facts
Provide answer to problem
Logical simplicity
Not contradict established facts

Why Important?
Direction to research
Operationalize procedure
Select facts
Replicate research
Draw logical conclusion
Relation between variables
Provides a statement deduced from theory
Aims to Find?
Difference
Relationship (Statistically significant ‚Äì Implies difference in result did not occur by chance)
Interaction
Null versus Alternative Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (ùêª_0)
No statistical significance between the two variables. 
Researcher is trying to disprove it.¬†
Individual is free from disease
Relationship is due to chance
Alternative Hypothesis (ùêª_ùëé)
Statistical significance between the two variables. 
Researcher is trying to approve it¬†
Individual has disease
Relationship is not due to chance
If ùêª_ùëé is accepted, ùêª_0 is rejected
Substantive vs. Statistical
Substantive ‚Äì expected relation b/w variables, not operationalized
Statistical ‚Äì operationalized in terms of statistical parameter

Simple vs. Complex
Simple ‚Äì 1 IV & 1 DV
Complex ‚Äì 2 or more IV & 2 or more DV
Practical vs. Statistical
Practical ‚Äì In terms of practical outcomes
Statistical ‚Äì In statistical outcomes
Positive, Negative or Null
Null ‚Äì no relation b/w IV & DV
Positive 
Negative
Universal vs. Existential 
Universal ‚Äì all variables are true at all times
‚ÄúBrave soldiers if rewarded will perform well‚Äù
Existential ‚Äì exist atleast for one particular case
‚ÄúFew corporate staff might not perform well despite reward‚Äù
